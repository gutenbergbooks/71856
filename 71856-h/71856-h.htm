<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">E</span><span class="afterlargecap">ven</span> though the home-built
“bearcat” roadster, or other favorite
model, does not compare in
every detail with the luxurious manufactured
cars, it has an individuality
that puts it in a class by itself. The
amateur mechanic, or the ambitious
boy, who is fairly
skilled with tools, can
build at least the main
parts for his own small
car, of the simple,
practical design shown
in the sketch and detailed
in the working
drawings. If necessary,
he can call more
skilled mechanics to
his aid. A motorcycle
engine, or other small
gasoline motor, is used
for the power plant.
The control mechanism
of the engine and
the electrical connections are similar
to those of a motorcycle. They are
installed to be controlled handily from
the driver’s seat. The car is built
without springs, but these may be
included, if desired, or the necessary
comfort provided—in part at least—by
a cushioned seat. Strong bicycle
wheels are used, the 1¹⁄₂ by 28-in. size
being suitable. The hood may be of
wood, or of sheet metal, built over a
frame of strap iron. The top of the
hood can be lifted off, and the entire
hood can also be removed, when repairs
are to be made. The tool box on
the rear of the frame can be replaced
by a larger compartment, or rack, for
transporting loads, or an extra seat for
a passenger.</p>

<p class="caption long">To Simplify This Small but Serviceable Motor Car for Construction by
the Young Mechanic, Only the Essential Parts are Considered. Other
Useful and Ornamental Features may be Added as the Skill and Means
of the Builder Make Possible</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The construction may be begun with
the chassis and the running gear. Fit
the wheels with ⁵⁄₈-in. axles, as shown
in the assembly views, <a href="#Fig0a">Figs. 1</a>, <a href="#Fig0b">2</a>, and
<a href="#Fig0c">3</a>, and detailed in <a href="#Fig0d">Fig. 4</a>. Fit the ends
of the axles to the hubs of the wheels,
providing the threaded ends with lock
nuts. Make the wooden supports for
the frame, as detailed in <a href="#Fig0f">Fig. 6</a>. The
axles are fastened into half-round
grooves, cut in the bottoms of the supports,
and secured by iron straps, as
shown in <a href="#Fig0d">Fig. 4</a>, at A. Make the sidepieces
for the main frame 2¹⁄₂ by 3¹⁄₄
in. thick, and 9 ft. 4 in. long, as detailed
in <a href="#Fig0g">Fig. 7</a>. Mortise the supports
through the sidepieces, and bore the
holes for the bolt fastenings and
braces. Glue the mortise-and-tenon
joints before the bolts are finally
secured. Provide the bolts with washers,
and lock the nuts with additional
jam nuts where needed. Keep the
woodwork clean, and apply a coat of
linseed oil, so that dirt and grease cannot
penetrate readily.</p>

<p>Finish only the supporting structure
of the chassis in the preliminary woodwork.
Set the front-axle and steering-rigging
supports C and D, and adjust
the spacers F between them. Bore
the hole for the kingbolt, as detailed
in <a href="#Fig0f">Fig. 6</a>, and fit the bevel gears and
the fifth wheel G, of ¹⁄₄-in. steel, into
place, as shown in <a href="#Fig0e">Fig. 5</a>. The gear H
is bolted to the axle support. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page2">[2]</span>
pinion J is set on the end of a short
³⁄₄-in. shaft. The latter passes through
the support D, and is fitted with washers
and jam nuts, solidly, yet with
sufficient play. A bracket, K, of ¹⁄₄ by
1³⁄₄-in. strap iron, braces the shaft, as
shown in <a href="#Fig0c">Fig. 3</a>. The end of this
short shaft is joined to one section of
the universal coupling, as shown, and,
like the other half of the coupling, is
pinned with a ³⁄₁₆-in. riveted pin. The
pinion is also pinned, and the lower
end of the kingbolt provided with a
washer and nut, guarded by a cotter
pin. Suitable gears can be procured
from old machinery. A satisfactory
set was obtained from an old differential
of a well-known small car.</p>

<p>Before fitting the steering column
into place, make the dashboard, of ⁷⁄₈-in.
oak, as shown in the assembly view,
and in detail in <a href="#Fig0g">Fig. 7</a>. It is 19¹⁄₂ in.
high and 2 ft. 4 in. wide, and set on the
frame and braced to it with 4 by 4 by
1¹⁄₂-in. angle irons, ¹⁄₄ in. thick. Fit a
⁷⁄₈-in. strip of wood around the edge of
the dashboard, on the front side, as a
rest for the hood, as shown in <a href="#Fig0a">Figs. 1</a>
and <a href="#Fig0g">7</a>, at L. A brass edging protects
the dashboard, and gives a neat
appearance. Lay out carefully the
angle for the steering column, which
is of ⁷⁄₈-in. shafting, so as to be convenient
for the driver. Mark the
point at which it is to pass through the
dashboard, and reinforce the hole
with an oak block, or an angle flange,
of iron or brass, such as is used on
railings, or boat fittings. A collar at
the flange counteracts the downward
pressure on the steering post. The 12-in.
steering wheel is set on the column
by a riveted pin.</p>

<p>The fitting of the engine may next
be undertaken. The exact position
and method of setting the engine on
the frame will depend on the size and
type. It should be placed as near the
center as possible, to give proper balance.
The drawings show a common
air-cooled motor of the one-cylinder
type. It is supported, as shown in
<a href="#Fig0a">Figs. 1</a> and <a href="#Fig0c">3</a> and detailed in <a href="#Fig2a">Fig. 8</a>.
Two iron strips, B, riveted to 1¹⁄₂ by
1¹⁄₂-in. angle irons, extend across the
main frame, and support the engine
by means of bolts and steel clamps,
designed to suit the engine. Cross
strips of iron steady the engine, and
the clamps are bolted to the crank
case. The center clamp is a band that
passes under the crank case.</p>

<p>The engine is set so that the crankshaft
extends across the main frame.
Other methods may be devised for
special motors, and the power
transmission changed correspondingly.
One end of the crankshaft is extended
beyond the right side of the frame, as
shown in <a href="#Fig0c">Fig. 3</a>. This extension is
connected to the shaft by means of an
ordinary setscrew collar coupling. A
block M, <a href="#Fig0c">Figs. 3</a> and <a href="#Fig0g">7</a>, is bolted to the
frame, and a section of heavy brass
pipe fitted as a bearing.</p>

<p>The ignition and oiling systems, carburetor,
and other details of the engine
control and allied mechanism, are
the same as those used on the motorcycle
engine originally, fitted up as
required. The oil tank is made of a
strong can, mounted on the dashboard,
as shown in <a href="#Fig0a">Figs. 1</a> and <a href="#Fig0b">2</a>. It is connected
with the crank case by copper
tubing. A cut-out switch for the ignition
system is mounted on the dashboard.
The controls used for the engine
of the motorcycle can be extended
with light iron rods, and the control
handles mounted on the dashboard or
in other convenient position. The
throttle can be mounted on the steering
column by fitting an iron pipe
around the post and mounting this<span class="pagenum" id="Page3">[3]</span>
pipe in the angle flange at the dashboard.
A foot accelerator may also be
used, suitable mountings and pedal
connections being installed at the
floor.</p>

<p>In setting the gasoline tank, make
only as much of the body woodwork
as is necessary to support it, as shown
in <a href="#Fig0a">Figs. 1</a>, <a href="#Fig0c">3</a>, and <a href="#Fig0g">7</a>. The tank may be
made of a can, properly fitted, and
heavy enough, as determined by comparison
with gasoline tanks in commercial
cars. The feed is through a copper
tube, as shown in <a href="#Fig0a">Fig. 1</a>. A small
venthole, to guard against a vacuum
in the tank, should be made in the cap.
The muffler from a motorcycle is used,
fitted with a longer pipe, and suspended
from the side of the frame.</p>

<p>The transmission of the power from
the motor shaft to the right rear
wheel is accomplished by means of a
leather motorcycle belt, made by fitting
leather washers close together
over a bicycle chain, oiling the washers
with neat’s-foot oil. A grooved iron
pulley is fitted on the end of the motor
shaft, and a grooved pulley rim on the
rear wheel, as shown in <a href="#Fig0a">Figs. 1</a> and <a href="#Fig0c">3</a>,
and detailed in <a href="#Fig0d">Fig. 4</a>. The motor is
started by means of a crank, and the
belt drawn up gradually, by the action
of a clutch lever and its idler, detailed
in <a href="#Fig3a">Fig. 9</a>. The clutch lever is forged,
as shown, and fitted with a ratchet
lever, N, and ratchet quadrant, O.
The idler holds the belt to the tension
desired, giving considerable flexibility
of speed.</p>

<p>The brake is shown in <a href="#Fig0a">Figs. 1</a> and <a href="#Fig0c">3</a>,
and detailed in <a href="#Fig0d">Figs. 4</a> and <a href="#Fig3a">9</a>. The fittings
on the rear wheel and axle are
made of wood, and bolted, with a
tension spring, as shown. The brake
drum is supported on iron bands, riveted
to the wheel, and to the pulley
rim. The brake arm is connected to
the brake wheel by a flexible wire.
When the pedal is forced down, the
wire is wound on the brake wheel,
thus permitting of adjustment. The
pedal is of iron and fixed on its shaft
with a setscrew. An iron pipe is used
as a casing for the central shaft, the
shaft carrying the clutch lever, and
the pipe carrying the brake pedal and
the brake wheel. The quadrant O is
mounted on a block, fastened to the
main frame. The central shaft is carried
in wooden blocks, with iron caps.
A catch of strap iron can be fitted on
the floor, to engage the pedal, and lock
the brake when desired.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The engine is cooled by the draft
through the wire-mesh opening in the
front of the hood, and through the
openings under the hood. If desirable,
a wooden split pulley, with
grooved rim and rope belt, may be
fitted on the extension of the engine
shaft, and connected with a two-blade
metal fan, as shown in <a href="#Fig0b">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p>The lighting arrangement may next
be installed, gas or electric lamps, run
on batteries, being used. Mudguards
are desirable if the car is to be used
on muddy roads. Strong bicycle mudguards
can be installed, the guard
braces being bolted on the axles. A
strong pipe, with a drawbolt passing
through its length, is mounted across
the front of the frame. The body is
built of ⁷⁄₈-in. stock, preferably white
wood, and is 2 ft. 4 in. wide. A priming
coat should be applied to the woodwork,
followed by two coats of the
body color, and one or two coats of
varnish. The metal parts, except at
the working surfaces, may be painted,
or enameled.</p>

<p>A neat and convenient method of
making a label for jars of preserves, or
similar preparations, to serve as a tab
for removing
the cover of
paraffin on the
glass, or dish, is
shown in the
sketch. The
tabs are cut
from tag board,
notched, as
shown, and bent
on the dotted
line. When melted
paraffin is
poured on top of
the material in
the jar, the tab is imbedded in it. To
remove the paraffin cover intact, a
pointed knife is run around the edge,
or the glass warmed sufficiently to
loosen the cover, which is then easily
removed.—Arthur M. Cranford, St.

small pin wheels,
one blue and the
other yellow.
The other arms
hold curious-shaped pieces of bright

<h2 class="nobreak">Simple Concealed Locking Device
for Cases of Drawers</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>A simple method of providing a
homemade locking device for a tier of
drawers, the use of only one keyed
lock being necessary, as is common
in manufactured cases, is shown in the
sketch. This is applicable to new or
old cases, where a space of about 1¹⁄₂
in. is available between the back of the
drawers and the rear of the case.</p>

<div class="container w25emmax" id="Fig4c">

<img src="images/illo008c.jpg" alt="Locking drawers">

</div><!--container-->

<p>The device, as detailed, consists of a
locking bar sliding in guides, screwed
or fastened to the back of the case.
Attached to the bar are latches one less
in number than there are drawers, and
spaced apart the distance that each
drawer top is
above the one
below. The upper
latch is the
master feature.
The top of this is
beveled off, forcing
it downward
when the top
drawer is closed.
The locking bar,
with the other
latches, also
moves down,
and the latch
fingers engage
the backs of the
drawers. The
connecting bar
is operated by a
light coil spring, set on a shouldered
rod at the bottom of the bar, as detailed.</p>

<p>The master latch may be attached
at any place on the bar, and should be
placed at the bottom drawer, for cases
too high to be reached handily. To
make the device for a small space, a
¹⁄₄-in. metal rod, with metal fingers
clamped on, can be used. Metal striking
plates are then put on the back
edges of the drawers.—G. A. Luers,
Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>To do away with the annoyance and
strain of holding up the heavy pole of
a mowing machine while fastening the
yoke strap to
the hames of a
restless team
of horses, I
equipped the
pole with a drop
stick, or rest.
This was made
of a 30-in. piece
of an old carriage
shaft. One end of the rod was
hinged to the underside of the pole as
shown. When the machine is in operation,
the stick is tied up out of the way
by means of a rope. This appliance
also lengthens the life of the pole, and
can be used on various kinds of vehicles.—T.

it will also pay the maker to

</div><!--container-->

<p>Begin the construction by gluing up
the pieces for the top and the shelf.
While they are drying, make the pieces
for the legs, the lower braces, and the
strips for the edging of the top. The
upper portion of the legs is of double
thickness, ⁷⁄₈-in. stock being used
throughout. Fit the lower supporting
framework together as shown in the
bottom view of the shelf, two of the
braces extending across the bottom and
the others butting against them.</p>

<p>When the top and shelf are dry, brace
the top with cleats screwed on underneath,
as shown in the bottom view of
the top. Lay out the shelf accurately,
and shape it to a perfect octagon, 25
in. across from opposite parallel sides.
Make a strip, 1⁵⁄₈ in. wide, and use it
in marking the layout for the top, from
the shelf as a pattern, the edges of the
top being parallel with those of the
shelf and 1⁵⁄₈ in. from them.</p>

<p>Assemble the parts as shown, using
glue and screws where practicable, and
properly set nails for places where the
fastening will be exposed. All the stock
should be cleaned up thoroughly both
before and after assembling. Four
pieces for the casters are fastened to
the legs with screws. The edging for
the top may be mitered, with a rounded
corner, as shown in the detail, or butted
square against the edge of the top, as
indicated in the photograph and the
plan of the top, the latter method being
far easier.</p>

<h2 class="lrgr nobreak">Making a Coasting Toboggan<br>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> A. M. PARKER</span></h2>

</div><!--container-->

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">E</span><span class="afterlargecap">ssentials</span> of a good toboggan,
whether for coasting or use in
transportation, are strength and lightness,
and when it is to be made in the
home shop, the construction must be
simple. That shown in the <a href="#Fig11b">illustration</a>,
and detailed in the <a href="#Fig12a">working sketches</a>,
was designed to meet these requirements.
The materials for the toboggan
proper and the forms over which it is
bent, may be obtained at small expense.</p>

<p>Smoothness of finished surface, freedom
from tendency to splinter, and
ability to stand up under abuse being
requisite qualities in the wood used to
make a toboggan, three varieties may
be mentioned in their order of merit:
hickory, birch, and oak. Birch is softer
than hickory and easily splintered, but
acquires an excellent polish on the
bottom. Oak stands bending well, but
does not become as smooth on the
running surface as close-grained woods.
Do not use quarter-sawed oak because
of the cross-grain flakes in its structure.</p>

<p>While the best toboggan is made of
a single board, both the securing of
material and its construction are rather
difficult. Narrow strips are easily bent
to shape, but do not make a durable
article. A toboggan made of four
boards is practical. The mill bill for
one 7¹⁄₂ ft. long by 16 in. wide and for
the bending frame, is as follows:</p>

<p>The form for the bending of the
pieces is made of the common boards
and the block. A block sawed from
the end of a dry log is excellent. Heat
it, if convenient, just before bending
the strips. The boards for the bottom
should be selected for straightness of
grain and freedom from knots and
burls. Carefully plane the side
intended for the wearing surface, and
bevel the edges so that, when placed
together, they form a wide “V” joint,
half the depth of the boards. The 1 by
1-in. pieces are for cross cleats and
should be notched on one side, 1 in.
from each end, to receive the side ropes.
The two ¹⁄₂ by 1-in. pieces are to be
placed one at each side of the extreme
end of the bent portion, to reinforce it.</p>

centers of the 1 by 2 by 18-in pieces,
and 4¹⁄₄ in. each side of this hole, bore
two others. Nail the end of one of the
6-ft. boards to each end of the block,
so that their extended ends are parallel.
With 3-in. nails, fasten one of the bored
pieces to the block between the boards,
inserting, temporarily, a ¹⁄₂-in. piece
to hold it out that distance from the
block.</p>

<p>Steam about 3 ft. of the ends of the
boards, or boil them in a tank. Clamp,
or nail, the boards together, at the dry
ends, edge to edge, between two of the
1 by 2-in. pieces, leaving about ¹⁄₄-in.
opening between boards. Thrust the
steamed ends under the cleat nailed on
the block, the nails which hold it slipping
up between the boards. Bear down
on the toboggan carefully, nailing on
another of the bored cleats, when the
toboggan boards have been curved
around the block as far as the floor will
permit. The nails, of course, go
between the boards.</p>

<p>Now, turn the construction over and
bend up the toboggan, following the
boards around the block with more of
the nailed cleats, until the clamped end
is down between the two 6-ft. boards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page13">[13]</span>
where it can be held by a piece nailed
across. More of the cleats may be
nailed on if desired; in fact, the closer
together the cleats are the less danger
there is of splintering the boards, and
the more perfect the conformity of the
boards to the mold.</p>

<p>Allow at least four days for drying
before removing the boards from the
form. Clamp the ¹⁄₂ by 1-in. pieces one
each side of the extreme ends of the
bent bows, drill holes through, and
rivet them. A 1 by 1-in. crossbar is
riveted to the inside of the bow at the
extreme front and another directly
under the extremity of the curved end.
These cleats are wired together to hold
the bend of the bow. The tail end
crossbar should be placed not nearer
than 2¹⁄₂ in. from the end of the boards,
while the remainder of the crossbars
are evenly spaced between the front
and back pieces, taking care that the
notched side is always placed down.
Trim off uneven ends, scrape and sandpaper
the bottom well, and finish the
toboggan with oil. Run a ³⁄₈-in. rope
through the notches under the ends of
the cross pieces, and the toboggan is
completed.</p>

<p>Screws are satisfactory substitutes
for rivets in fastening together the
parts, and wire nails, of a length to
allow for about ¹⁄₄-in. clinch, give a fair
job. Indians overcome the lack of
hardware by the use of rawhide, laced
through diagonally staggered holes
bored through the crosspieces and
bottom boards. Rawhide, which they
sometimes stretch over the bow as a
protection, affords an opportunity for
elaborate ornamentation.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Finding that dry batteries had increased
in price, and requiring a number
for experimental purposes, I devised
the following method by which I
was able to use the old batteries for a
considerable period: When the dry
cells were nearly exhausted, I punched
holes through the zinc covering with a
nail, as shown in the sketch. The holes
were placed about 1¹⁄₂ in. apart, and
care was taken
not to punch
them near the
upper edge of the
container, or the
black insulation
might thus be injured.
The cells
were then placed in a saturated solution
of sal ammoniac. The vessel containing
the liquid must be filled only to
within ¹⁄₂ in. from the top of the cell,
otherwise the binding posts will be corroded,
and the cell probably short-circuited.
The cells were left in the
solution six hours, and then became remarkably
live. They must not be connected
or permitted to come into contact
with each other while in the
solution.—H. Sterling Parker, Brooklyn,

may be accomplished by fitting it with
a simple electrical device, as shown in
the sketch. The general arrangement

case is shown in <a href="#Fig15a">Fig. 1</a>; a detail of the
silk cord and other connections of the
contact key and the gong hammer, is

has been in operation for several years,
and has been found practical.</p>

<p class="caption">The General Arrangement of the Apparatus for Transmitting
the Striking of a Clock Gong is Shown in
Fig. 1, and a Detail of the Contact Device in Fig. 2</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The various rooms to which the
striking of the gong is to be transmitted
are wired with No. 18 annunciator
wire, run carefully behind picture
moldings and in corners. Where the
wires must be carried through a partition,
a ¹⁄₄-in. hole is sufficiently large
for the purpose. The single-stroke
bells are wired up as shown in the
sketch. The number of dry batteries
necessary varies with the number of
bells in the circuit, and also depends
on the length of wire through which
the current is carried. A trial should
be made with several batteries and
more added until the bells are rung
properly.</p>

<p>The connecting device may be fitted
into the clock case without defacing it
by boring holes in its side, and the
binding posts are fixed into place
neatly. The two sections of the contact
key, shown in detail in <a href="#Fig15a">Fig. 2</a>, are
fastened to the back of the clock case
with bolts. The upper member is fitted
with an adjustable thumbscrew and is
stationary on the bolt fastening. The
lower arm is made of covered wire and
is pivoted on the supporting bolt. Attached
to its lower edge, at the pivot, is
a small lever arm. This is connected
to the hammer rod of the gong with a
silk cord. The length of the cord must
be determined by careful adjustment
so that it will not hinder the action
of the hammer H, but will bring the
swinging arm into proper contact with
the thumbscrew. The contact should
be made at the instant the hammer
strikes the bell. The contact of the
platinum point of the thumbscrew and
the swinging arm must be close, but
not too strong. Metal posts or tubes
fitted over the bolts, at the points
where the arms are attached to the
back of the clock case, may be used to
bring the arms the proper distance forward
in the case, so that they will be
in alinement with the hammer rod.
The silk cord must not interfere with
the action of the pendulum P. To hold
the silk cord in place on the hammer
rod, drop a small piece of melted sealing
wax or solder on the rod.—W. E.

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">L</span><span class="afterlargecap l">arge</span> spread of canvas and great
speed when running with the
wind, or “free”; stability under heavy
wind, and adaptability to sailing under
conditions similar to those of the common,
single-boom-and-sheet ice boat,
are the features of the ice yacht shown
in the <a href="#Fig19">illustration</a>. The runner and
frame structure is in general typical of
ice-boat construction. The double, or
wishbone, mast is distinctive, as is the
double-boom and sail arrangement,
shown in Figs. 1 and 6. The booms
are pivoted at the bow of the craft, and
controlled at the stern by the usual line
and pulley rigging. The booms may
be spread so that a V-shaped cavity is
afforded for taking the wind when running
free, or they may be brought together
and both sails manipulated as a
single sheet. Reefing and lowering of
the sails are accomplished in the usual
manner. The framework is very substantial
and the proportions are of moderate
range, so that the craft may be
constructed economically for one or
two passengers. The double-boom feature
may be omitted if the craft is to
be used where little or no opportunity
is afforded for running before the wind,
by reason of the particular ice areas
available. For the experimenter with
sailing craft, the wishbone-mast ice
yacht affords opportunity for adaptation
of the various elements of the
craft described, and is a novelty. The
dimensions given are for a small yacht,
and care must be taken, in adapting the
design, to maintain proper proportions
for stability and safety. A side view
with working dimensions is shown in
Fig. 1; inset into it is Fig. 6, showing
a front view of the mast and sail arrangement.
Figure 2 shows a view of
the framework from below. A detail
of the fastening of the backbone and
runner plank is shown in Fig. 3; a detail
of the fastening of the masts and
the forward runners into the runner
plank, in Fig. 4, and the fixture by
which the booms and the yard are attached
to the forward end of the backbone,
in Fig. 5.</p>

<p>The construction should begin with
the making of the lower framework, as
shown in Fig. 2 viewed from the lower
side. The main frame consists of a
backbone, of spruce or white pine, 4 in.
thick, 8 in. high at the center, and 16 ft.
long, clamped accurately at right angles
to a runner plank, of the same material,
2 in. thick, 10 in. wide, and 12 ft.
6 in. long. The backbone is tapered
from the middle portion, 5 ft. 6 in. from
the forward end, and with a ridge, 8 in.
high and 2 ft. 6 in. long, measured from
the end of the taper at this end, as
shown in Fig. 1. It is tapered to 4 in.
at each end, and the bow end is fitted
with a three-eye metal ring, as shown
in detail in Fig. 5. The runner plank
and the backbone are clamped together
firmly at their crossing, the backbone
being set upon the plank, by means of
two strap bolts, with washers and nuts,
as shown in detail in Fig. 3. Only the
best material should be used in the
backbone and runner plank, and the
stock should be straight-grained, to
give the greatest strength.</p>

<p>The runner plank is tapered down to
8 in. at its ends, to which the guides for
the forward runners are fixed. The
guides are of straight-grained oak, 1¹⁄₂
by 3 by 14 in., bolted to the runner
plank with ⁵⁄₁₆-in. carriage bolts, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page18">[18]</span>
shown in the detail sketch, Fig. 4, and
in Fig. 2. The guides and the ends of
the plank are reinforced with oak
chocks, bolted in place at each of the
tapered edges of the plank. The forward
runners are of oak, 1¹⁄₂ by 5 by
36 in., shaped at their ends as shown,
and shod with half-round strap iron.
The heads of the screws used for this
purpose are countersunk carefully. The
runners are pivoted on ⁵⁄₈-in. bolts, the
nuts being set to the inner side. Washers
and jam nuts should be provided,
or the ends of the bolts riveted slightly,
to prevent the nuts from becoming
loosened.</p>

<p>The stern runner is of oak, 1¹⁄₂ by 5
by 30 in., shod like the forward runners,
and is pivoted in a forged
wrought-iron hanger. The lower portion
of the hanger may be made of a
strip of heavy iron, bent into a U-shape,
and drilled to receive a ³⁄₈-in. bolt, on
which the runner pivots. The U-shaped
piece is riveted firmly to a vertical
shaft, provided with a heavy rubber
washer, protected from wear by a metal
one, as indicated at the right in Fig. 1.
The upper end of the shaft is threaded
to receive a washer and nut. A section
of pipe is fitted over the shaft, and the
steering handle, fitted to a square section
of the shaft, is clamped securely.</p>

<p>The cockpit is fixed to the lower side
of the backbone, and is 5 ft. long and 3
ft. wide, with coaming, 4 in. high. It is
shown with square corners, since this
construction is convenient, though not
as good as the type having the ends of
the cockpit rounded, and fitted with
coaming steamed and bent to the curve.
The floor of the cockpit is fastened to
the backbone with lag screws, and the
coaming is also fastened securely; this
construction, if carefully made, will afford
ample strength. If desired, especially
in larger craft, ribs may be fixed
to the backbone, to carry the cockpit.</p>

<p>The runners, the runner plank, and
the backbone must be alined carefully,
so that they are at right angles, and
track properly; otherwise the craft will
not keep a true course, and cannot be
controlled properly by the rudder runner.
The backbone and runner plank
are held rigidly by four ¹⁄₄-in. wire-rope
stays, shown in Fig. 2. They are fixed
to eyes on the bands at the bow, near
the ends of the runner plank, and to an
eyebolt below the cockpit. The stays
are provided with turnbuckles, so that
they may be adjusted as required. The
bands near the ends of the runner plank
are fixed to the lower ends of the masts,
as shown in detail in Fig. 4, and are reinforced
with oak blocks. The ends of
the guy wires are fastened to the eyes
by looping them and clamping the resulting
eye with steel clamps made for
this purpose. Metal thimbles may be
fitted into the loop of the rope, to make
a better finish; other fastenings may
easily be devised by one skilled enough
to make such a construction.</p>

<p>The wishbone mast is made of two
poles of hickory or ash, 3¹⁄₂ in. thick at
the base, and tapered to 2 in. at the
top. The poles are joined carefully at
the masthead, bolted together, and fitted
to an oak breast hook, as shown
in Fig. 6. An iron strap reinforces the
joint, and an eye, fashioned at its upper
end, affords a point of attachment for
the forward stay of the mast. The
lower ends of the poles forming the
mast are fitted into sockets in the runner
plank, which is reinforced with
mast blocks, as shown in Fig. 4. The
ends of the mast, projecting beyond the
lower side of the runner plank, are
fitted with eye bands, used in guying
the runner plank and backbone.</p>

<p>The sails are carried on a yard and
two booms, of the same material as the
masts, each 16 ft. long, 2³⁄₄ in. at the
middle and tapering to 1¹⁄₂ in. at the
ends. They are fitted with metal rings
at the ends to prevent splitting. The
yard and booms are fitted to the backbone
at the bow by means of loops
bolted to them and engaging an eyebolt
and ring on the backbone. The
eyebolt is fitted into a slotted plate of
³⁄₁₆-in. sheet iron, and fastened by a
lever nut, as shown in Fig. 5. The
sheets are fastened to the yard and
booms in the usual manner, being fitted
with grommets, and tied with line. The
yard is suspended from the masthead
by means of a line and pulley, the
former being cleated to the backbone.
The booms are controlled by the operator
from the cockpit, by the use of
lines and pulleys, similar to the arrangement
used on sailboats, except
that a duplicate set is required for the
additional boom. The lines are cleated
on the backbone convenient to the
cockpit.</p>

<p>The sails are of the lateen type, and
should be made of 8-oz. unbleached cotton
duck. The breadths are sewn together
by lapping one edge over the
other about 1 in., and sewing or stitching
along the edge. Yard-wide material
is satisfactory, and if narrower
laps or bights are desired, simply fold
over 1 in. of the goods and double-stitch
the seam. The bights should run
parallel with the after, or leach, edge
of the sail, as shown in Fig. 1. Each
corner of the sail should be reinforced
with a triangular patch of duck, so that
it will stand up under the severe strain
of winter usage. The edges of the sail
may be bound with ¹⁄₄-in. tarred rope,
which is not difficult if a sailor’s palm
and a diamond-pointed needle are used.
Sail twine, well waxed, should be used
for the sewing of the sails.</p>

<p>The edges of the sails adjoining the
yard and booms are provided with
grommet holes by means of which the
sails are attached to their supports.
The grommets are made by punching
holes in the sails, at the proper points,
fitting two ³⁄₄-in. brass grommet rings
into the holes, one at each side, and
overcasting them with a buttonhole
stitch. The sail needle and waxed sail
twine are used. The reef points are of
the usual type, and are made of ¹⁄₈-in.
cotton rope, whipped at the ends to prevent
raveling, and sewed to the sails
at intervals.</p>

<p>The craft is designed to be taken
down when not in use, particularly between
seasons, and can be stored in
comparatively small space, in the
knockdown form. The method of setting
up the ice yacht will serve to illustrate,
also, the method of taking it
down, in that the process is practically
reversed. First, the backbone is fitted
with the forward ring and the strap
bolts are fastened at the crossing of the
backbone and runner plank. The runners
are fitted into place, and the steering
rigging is adjusted. The wishbone
mast is set into its steps, clamped at its
masthead, and the bands fitted to the
lower ends. The guy wires at the bottom
and that at the masthead are then
set, by means of the turnbuckles. The
sails are attached to the yard and
booms, and the forward end of the latter
supports are fixed into place. The
pulley at the masthead is fitted with
³⁄₈-in. rope which is fastened to the
yard, at the proper point, as indicated
in Fig. 1. The rigging by which the
booms are controlled is threaded
through the pulleys at the stern and the
ends fixed on the cleats. The yard may
now be hauled up and the craft trimmed
so that the sails “set” properly. The
halyard is fixed to the yard, as shown,
and run through a pulley at the masthead,
then down through a second pulley
fixed to the runner plank, from
which it is conducted to cleats convenient
to the operator in the cockpit.</p>

<p>The main sheets are rigged as shown
in Fig. 1. The ends of the lines are
lashed to the ends of the booms, passed
through pulleys, at the stern of the
backbone, on the booms, about 1 ft.
from the ends, and 5 ft. from the ends,
respectively, then down to the cleats at
the cockpit. This rigging gives good
purchase on the lines and makes it convenient
for the operator to attend to
the helm and the lines at the same time.
The fittings are, as nearly as possible,
designed to be standard and may be
purchased from ship chandlers, or dealers
in marine hardware and fittings.
The special metal parts may be made
by one of fair mechanical skill, or may
be made by local blacksmiths. The
woodwork is all comparatively simple.
The masts, yard, and booms should
be smoothed carefully, sandpapered
lightly, and finished with several coats
of spar varnish. The other woodwork
may be painted suitably, and the metal
fittings should be finished with two
coats of red lead, or other good paint
for use on metals exposed to the
weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page21">[21]</span></p>

<p>The manipulation of this craft is in
general similar to that of the common
lateen-rig, or other sail and ice, boats.
When running before the wind—free—the
booms are separated and the wind
acts against the sails in the pocket between
them. When tacking, the booms
are brought together, and the sails act
as one sheet, on a craft of the ordinary
type.</p>

Board</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Draftsmen, whose work demands the
use of drawing paper of uniform size,
sometimes experience difficulty in fixing
thumb tacks solidly in the board.
This is caused by the continual placing
of tacks in the same spot and may be
overcome by the use of cork plugs
which can be removed when worn. At
the four points where the tacks are
generally placed, bore 1-in. holes nearly
through the board. Insert corks large
enough to be forced into the holes and
trim them off flush with the surface.
Tacks will hold firmly in them and
new corks may be inserted as needed.

it is desirable to have the base and cap
pieces of thicker stuff. The uprights

The cap is 1¹⁄₂ in. square, and its edges
are chamfered slightly, as are those on

are fitted together with small brads,
used as hidden dowels, and the joints
are glued. Brads may be used to nail
the pieces together, and they should be
sunk into the wood, and the resulting

be stained a dark color, or left natural,
and given a coat of shellac or varnish.</p>

Containers</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>In pouring a liquid from a jug or bottle,
the vessel should be held with the
opening downward, rather than horizontally,
if convenient, and swung
quickly with a circular motion. The
liquid will rotate and in leaving the
opening will permit air to enter continuously,
causing the liquid to run out
rapidly and without intermittent gurgling
sounds. If the opening of the
container is at one side it is best to
hold the container so that the opening
is at the highest point of the end rather
than at the bottom. The air may thus
enter and permit a continuous flow
until the container is empty.—E. F.

Modern Skis</p>

</div><!--container-->

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">T</span><span class="afterlargecap">he</span> requirements of the modern ski
call for a hard, flexible, and tough
material, and while hickory, white ash,
white maple, birch, yellow pine, white
pine, and spruce are all used, the experienced
ski runner considers hickory and
ash to combine in the fullest measure
the qualities most desired. Of course,
every wood has its limitations as well
as merits. Hickory is elastic and fairly
tough, but heavy. Ash resembles hickory
so far as elasticity is concerned, and
its weight is about the same, but the
wood contains soft layers. Birch possesses
the requisite lightness, but is far
too brittle to prove serviceable, and pine
is open to the same objection. Maple
makes an excellent ski, which can be
finished very smooth so as to slide more
easily than the other woods, but it is
much less flexible than either hickory
or ash.</p>

<h3>The Telemark-Model Ski</h3>

<p>This form of ski, so called from the
Telemarken province of Norway, where
the art of ski running has reached a
high order of skill, is probably the
choice of the sportsmen wherever the
exhilarating sport of ski running is
practiced, and the larger portion of the
members of the numerous skiing clubs
use the Telemark-model ski. This type
is practically identical with the most
popular model so long used in Telemarken,
and the rule for its selection is
to choose a pair whose length reaches
the middle joint of the fingers when the
arm is stretched above the head. There
are various makers of this type of ski,
and while the modeling will be found
to differ but little, there are numerous
brands sold which are fashioned of
cheap and flimsy material, and consequently
unsatisfactory in every respect.</p>

<p>The Telemark model is shown in
<a href="#Fig25">Fig. 1</a>, and from this sketch it will be
seen that the wood has two curves or
bends, one running its entire length to
form a graceful arch, and the second,
at the toe. The first one is technically
known as the “arch,” and the other
curve the “bend,” while the front or toe
end of the ski is called the “point,” and
the rear end the “heel.” In almost all
skis the under, or running, surface is
provided with a hollow, known as the
“groove,” which runs from the heel to
the bend. It will be noticed in the
drawing that the sides also are gently
curved, thus making the ski a trifle
broader at the ends than in the center.
This curve affords a somewhat greater
bend at the heel, and while some experts
approve, others disapprove of it, but
most ski runners agree that the curve
should not be pronounced, or it will
prove a handicap and make it difficult
for the runner to secure a firm grip at
the edge when ascending steep slopes
covered with hard snow.</p>

<p>The “arch” of the ski is necessary to
avoid bending when the weight of the
body is on the runner, and the total
height of this important curve should
not exceed ³⁄₄ in., for a too exaggerated
arch will practically form a concave
running surface and retard the speed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page24">[24]</span>
since it will run on two edges, or points,
instead of on the entire running surface.
A slight arch may be reckoned necessary
to offset the weight of the body,
but the utility of the ski, in nearly
every instance, will be less affected by
too little arch than by too great a curve
at this point.</p>

<p>A good ski is told at a glance by its
bend, which must never be abruptly
formed, nor carried too high. A maximum
curve of 6 in. is all that is ever
required, and to prevent breaking at
this, the weakest, part of the ski, the
bend must be gradual like the curve of
a good bow, thus making it more flexible
and elastic at this point. As a rule,
the ski should be fashioned a trifle
broader at the bend than at any other
point, and the wood should be pared
moderately thin, which will make it
strong and resilient with plenty of
spring, or “backbone.”</p>

<p>The groove in the running surface is
so formed as to make the ski steady and
prevent “side slip” when running
straightaway. In fact this groove may
be compared to the keel of a boat, and
as the latter may be made too deep,
making it difficult to steer the craft and
interfering with the turning, so will the
badly formed groove interfere with the
control of the ski. The Telemark
round-faced groove is by far the best
form, and for all-around use is commonly
made ¹⁄₁₂ or ¹⁄₈ in. deep. Not all
Telemark skis are thus fashioned, however,
some being made without the
groove, while others are provided with
two, and I have seen one marked with
three parallel hollows. The shallow
groove is the most satisfactory for general
use, and while a groove, ³⁄₈ or ¹⁄₂ in.
deep, is good enough for straightaway
running, it makes turning more difficult.</p>

<p>To attach the ski binding, which secures
the shoe to the runner, a hole in
the form of a narrow slit is made just
back of the center. This is the usual
manner of attaching the foot binding,
and while it cannot but weaken the ski
to a certain extent, it is the best method
for making a secure foot fastening, and
weakens the wood to a much less extent
than the use of bolts, or other metal
fastening.</p>

<p>So far as finish is concerned, most
Norwegian makers finish their skis with
a coat of black paint, while other makers
stain the wood, and some finish the
wood in the natural color by varnishing.
This applies to the upper surface only,
the running surface being rubbed down
with linseed oil and made smooth with
wax.</p>

<h3>The Swedish Ski</h3>

<p>This type of ski is made quite long
and comparatively narrow, with a deep
groove, and is well adapted for running
on the level or for gliding down
slight slopes. This type of ski is commonly
used in Lapland and to a less
extent in the northern parts of Norway,
but the great length and quick,
short bend make this model less
adapted for ordinary use, since the deep,
rectangular groove slows down the
speed, and the great length makes turning
doubly difficult. For special conditions
this type is probably useful, but it
can scarcely be considered suited to the
average use.</p>

<h3>Lilienfeld Ski</h3>

<p>This type of ski is favored by but
comparatively few ski runners, and the
modeling is inferior to the Telemark
ski. The arch is excessive in height,
the bend is abrupt and stiff, while the
round point, fashioned to prevent sticking
in loose brush, has apparently little
value in actual use. The Lilienfeld ski
is made without a groove, and since the
whole model is shorter and broader than
the usual type of ski, turning is more
easily accomplished, but side slipping
is, of course, considerably increased.
Ease in turning is a desirable quality,
to be sure, but steadiness and immunity
from side slipping are far more valuable
qualities in a ski designed for all-around
use. In short, the Lilienfeld model possesses
no decided advantages over the
Telemark type, but has many points of
inferiority. To one who has used both
models there can be no question but
that the Telemark model is preferable.</p>

<p>When purchasing skis the sportsman<span class="pagenum" id="Page25">[25]</span>
will make no mistake in selecting the
Telemark model, and for an active person
the skis should be long enough to
reach to the middle joint of the fingers,
when the arms are stretched above the
head, and the ski is stood upright on its
heel. The length of a pair so selected
will be from 7¹⁄₂ to 8 ft. For elderly
and less active persons, for individuals
of short stature, and for ladies, skis
reaching to the wrist joint will be about
right; the length ranging from 6¹⁄₂ to
7 ft. For youths and children shorter
skis, from 5 to 6 ft. in length, according
to the size and strength of the
person, are of course required.</p>

The Telemark, Swedish and Lilienfeld Models with Grooves and Grooveless Bottoms, the Telemark Being
the Standard and Best All-Around Ski; the Swedish is Long and Narrow with Upturned Heel, and
the Lilienfeld Is Short with a Round Point, More Abrupt Bend, and without a Groove</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>For all-around use where a large
amount of straight running is done, the
running surface should be provided
with a groove, but if there is not much
straight work to be done, and ease in
turning is regarded as an important factor,
the running surface should be made
smooth. This necessitates making the
skis to order, for practically all ready-made
skis of the Telemark model are
fashioned with a shallow groove.
However, a groove may be easily cut
in at any time if wanted later on. While
other types are at times preferred for
special use in certain localities, the Telemark-model
ski is the standard, being
equally good for all kinds of work,
straight running, uphill skiing, and for
jumping.</p>

<p>The best materials are hickory, or
white ash, with a straight, even grain
running from end to end. Ash is well
liked by many experts, but it would indeed
be difficult to find a more satisfactory
wood than our American hickory.
In fact, many of the most prominent
makers in Europe are now fashioning
their skis from American timber.
As a rule, the best well-seasoned ash,
or hickory, is heavier in weight than
an inferior grade, and this is why the
expert skier considers weight as one of
the reliable “earmarks” of first-class
material. A good hickory, or ash, ski
made by any reputable maker will give
the fullest measure of satisfaction.</p>

<p>The finish of skis is purely a matter
of personal taste, but practically all
Norwegian skis are painted black on
the upper side, while a few of the
cheaper maple and pine implements are
stained. The plain varnished finish
protects the wood as well as paint, but
allows the grain to show through, and
is generally preferred by experts. The
running surface must be as smooth as
possible to obtain the best speed, and it
must not be varnished, the wood being
filled with several coats of linseed oil
to which a little wax has been added.<span class="pagenum" id="Page26">[26]</span>
Tar is used to some extent, but this
preparation is mostly employed by
Swedish makers.</p>

<h3>The Requirements of Foot Binding</h3>

<div class="container w30emmax" id="Fig26a">

<img src="images/illo030.jpg" alt="Ski shoe binding">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 2</span></p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The manner in which the foot is secured
to the ski is highly important, and
while various kinds of “bindings” are
in use, from the
simple cane binding,
which
marked the first
substantial improvement
over
the twisted birch
withes originally
used by the peasantry of Telemarken,
the Huitfeldt bindings are for many
reasons considered the best by experts.
The ski runner must have a foot binding
that is well secured under all ordinary
conditions met with in ski running,
and it must be quite rigid and
without lateral play. It is desirable
also that the foot be freed whenever a
fall occurs, thus preventing possible
sprains at the ankle and knee, as well
as avoiding breakage of the straps.
Again the heel of the skier should be
free to move up and down for at least
3 in., but the binding should check the
vertical movement at this height, thus
easing the foot of undue strain when the
ski is slid forward, in climbing or working
on the level. These essential specifications
are so well incorporated in the
Huitfeldt model that the description
and illustrations of this admirable attachment
will suffice. As shown in
<a href="#Fig26a">Fig. 2</a>, the boot is wedged into a firm
position between the metal toe piece at
the sides. To secure a rigid support,
these toe pieces must be firmly wedged
in position on the ski, and the skiing
shoe should fit between them snugly
and well. For this type of binding, a
shoe having a stout sole is desirable so
that it may keep rigid under the pressure
of the body at various angles, and
be heavy enough to stand the more or
less constant chafing of the metal toe
plates. One excellent feature of this
binding is the arrangement of the toe
and heel straps, which allow all necessary
vertical movement of the foot, yet
at the same time provide a fairly rigid
strong, and reasonably light foot attachment.
When fitted with the Ellefsen
tightening clamp, and it is a good
plan to order the Huitfeldt model so
equipped, the skis are easily put on and
taken off. A large number of experts
prefer this binding above all others, but
the Huitfeldt type of binding may be
made by the skier if desired. Any metalworker
or blacksmith can supply the
metal toe pieces, and the binding may
be completed by adding suitable straps,
or the foot may be secured at the heel
by leather thongs.</p>

<h3>The Skiing Stick</h3>

<p>While there are occasions when the
proficient ski runner can dispense with
the stick, as in jumping and practicing
many fancy turns and swings, a good
stick must be reckoned a valuable implement
for climbing and downhill running,
and often a help on a level. The
beginner should not depend too much
upon the stick, however, but should acquire
the knack of handling the skis
without this aid early in his practice.
In short, the novice should practice both
with and without the stick, that he may
learn all the little points of balancing
the body unaided, but every skier ought
to know how to use the stick, that he
may rely upon its assistance whenever
necessary.</p>

<div class="container w50emmax" id="Fig26b">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 3</span><br>
Skiing Sticks with Staff of Bamboo or Hard Wood
Having an Easily Removable Aluminum Washer</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The use of two sticks may be of help
for mountain climbing, but the majority
of ski runners consider one stout stick
to be of more real service. For downhill
running, the extra stick is of no
value whatever, but rather a hindrance,
the one stick being all that is required
for braking. In choosing a stick, its
height may be such that it will reach
to the shoulders of the skier, although
many prefer a shorter one. On the average,
a stick 5 ft. long will be found
about right for most persons, while a
proportionately shorter stick will be required
for boys and girls. Bamboo of
good quality is generally preferred,
since it is light, elastic, and very stiff
and strong. Hardwood sticks are a
trifle heavier, but if fashioned from
straight-grain hickory, or ash, are as<span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span>
satisfactory as the bamboo. In any
case, the end of the stick should be provided
with a metal ice peg, and a ferrule
to strengthen the wood at this
point. A few inches above the peg a
ring, or disk, is fastened, and this
“snow washer” serves to keep the stick
from sinking too deeply into the snow.
Wicker rings, secured with thongs or
straps, are much used, as are also disks
of metal and hard rubber. A decided
improvement over these materials has
been brought out in a cup-shaped snow
washer made of aluminum, which is
flexible and fastened to the stick with
clamps so that it can be easily shifted
or removed at will. This feature is a
good one, since the washer is often useful
for assisting braking in soft snow,
but is likely to catch and throw the
runner if used upon crusted snow,
hence the detachable arrangement is of
value in that it supplies an easy way to
take off the washer whenever desired.
The sticks are shown in <a href="#Fig26b">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

<h3>Necessities of the Skier’s Outfit</h3>

<p>For skiing an ordinary pair of heavy-soled
lace shoes that fit well are suitable,
but to keep the heel strap of a
binding from slipping, the shoes should
have broad, concave heels, or a small
strap and buckle, firmly sewed in place
at the extreme end of the heel, should
be fitted to them. Personally, I prefer
the heel strap to the special heel, but
any cobbler can fit the shoes with either
one. Specially designed skiing shoes,
or boots, as shown in <a href="#Fig27">Fig. 4</a>, are to be
had at the sporting-goods dealers’, and
while good, are somewhat expensive,
because most of them are imported. Of
course, shoes for skiing must be amply
large so that one or two pairs of woolen
socks may be worn; two pairs of thin,
woolen stockings being less bulky and
very much warmer than one extremely
heavy pair.</p>

<p>For clothing, the soft, smooth finish
of the regulation mackinaw garments
cannot be improved upon for outdoor
winter wear, although any suitable material
will serve as well. Smooth-finish
material is the best in all cases, because
cloth of rough texture will cause the
snow to stick and make it uncomfortable.
Regulation mackinaw trousers,
split at the bottom and fastened with
tapes to tie close to the ankle, are as
good as any, over which cloth puttees,
or leggings, may be worn to keep out
the snow. For the coat, a mackinaw,
made Norfolk-style, with belt and flap
pockets secured with a button, has
given me the most satisfaction. For
ladies, close-fitting knickerbockers and
leggings are generally preferred when
a short skirt is worn.</p>

<h3>How to Make Skis</h3>

<p>To anyone who can use a saw and
plane, the making of a pair of nicely
balanced and durable skis is a very easy
job. Ski making is far easier than
snowshoe construction, since each runner
is made from a single piece of plank,
and no intricate filling is required. In
choosing the wood, either hickory or
ash will give satisfaction, because both
are heavy woods, as well as strong and
flexible, and may be worked down much
thinner than birch, fir, or other materials.
If it is desired to fashion the skis
from the rough material, procure two
ash, or hickory, planks, about 9 ft. long
and 2 in. thick. Should the maker wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span>
to hew his own material, select a sound
and straight tree, about 10 in. in diameter,
free from knots for at least 10 ft.,
and fell it during the winter. Place the
log in the crotch of a stump and cut a
groove along its length with the ax,
taking pains that the groove is straight
and about 1 in. in depth. Turn the log
over and make a like groove in the opposite
side. Rap the bottom of the
grooves lightly with the ax, to start the
split, and drive in small wood wedges,
gradually working them along as the
wood splits. At some points the wood
will very likely split away from the
groove, but by cutting these fibers, the
split may be kept along the grooves. As
the strongest and best grain of the wood
will lie closest to the bark, only enough
of the outside should be hewn away to
make a flat surface, for this is to be the
running surface of the ski. Skis may
be made in any length and width, but
for a man of good height, 7 to 8 ft. is
the correct length. In <a href="#Fig28">Fig. 5</a> is given a
complete layout pattern for an 8-ft. ski,
and from the dimensions it is an easy
matter to fashion skis longer or shorter
by making use of these well-balanced
proportions. While the plan of the ski
may be drawn directly on the plank, it
is an excellent idea to make a paper pattern,
and laying this down on the board,
trace around it to get the correct outline.</p>

The Wood is Selected by the Way in Which the
Growth of the Grain Runs</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>When purchasing the sawed material,
the buyer should endeavor to obtain a
plank which has been sawed out from
the lower portion of the trunk of the
tree, from the outside. The dealer will
not be able to assist in choosing lumber
for this particular purpose, hence the
buyer should know something about the
growth of good wood in the tree, and
how to pick out this desirable material
by noting the run of the grain. This
is very well shown in <a href="#Fig29a">Fig. 6</a>. The letters
A, B, and C show the run of the
grain produced by the ring growth of
the tree, and D, E, and F indicate the
appearance of rings, in the run of the
grain seen in the sawed plank. The
best possible choice for wood is represented
by A and D, because the layers
of good and elastic wood run deep, and
there is practically no soft layers of
punky wood. That represented by B
and E, and that of C and F, contain a
larger percentage of soft layers, and
while skis can be, and often are, fashioned
from this kind of material, the
wood is less strong and flexible than
that of wood showing the grain as A
and D, hence the latter should be
chosen whenever it is possible to do so.
While wood of fairly close grain does
not necessarily indicate inferiority, if
the material is hickory, yet if ash is
selected, the purchaser should select
an open, or widely spaced, grain in preference
to a close and even-grained
plank. And this is so because in all
trees the grain represents the more
quickly grown soft wood—formed in
the period of greatest growth, which is
in the spring and summer months—hence
the more grain present in the
plank and the closer it runs, the more
soft and punky wood is present, and
the less durable the material will be for
the purpose.</p>

<p>When drawing the dimensions on
green, or partly seasoned, timber, a certain
amount of shrinkage will occur,
hence be sure to allow for this and make
the width about ¹⁄₄ in. greater. When
working seasoned lumber, this need not
be taken into consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page29">[29]</span></p>

<p>After the outline of the ski has been
sawed out, the bottom, or running surface,
should be planed perfectly smooth,
with the grain running straight and true
from the point to the heel. The ski
should be worked down to the desired
dimensions before bending, and from
the top, or upper, side only, never from
the running surface. When the correct
thickness has been reached, the bend
at the point may be put in by soaking
the wood well to make it pliable. This
is most easily done by heating water in
a wash boiler, and when the water boils,
place the ski across the top and thoroughly
soak the wood by mopping with
the boiling water, using a cloth tied to
a stick. That the bend may be gradual
and not too abrupt, do not attempt to
bend it to the desired arc at once, but
gradually work the wood and resort to
numerous hot-water treatments until a
good 6-in. bend is obtained. The arch
in the running surface is easily obtained,
and if bent too much, is easily
straightened out when cold. Of course,
more bend must be given the skis than
the actual curve will be when finished,
since the wood will straighten out
somewhat as it dries. Some kind of a
form will come in handy, and this may
be furnished by making a rough frame
and placing a short length of log of the
proper diameter at the bends, or the tips
may be lashed, or cleated, to the floor
of the workbench. A very easy method
is shown in <a href="#Fig29b">Fig. 7</a>.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 7</span></p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>After the bends are made, the hole
for the foot binding should be put in,
and if the wood has been left plenty
long, the skis may be trimmed off at the
heel so that they
will balance
nicely when lifted by
the toe straps.
This is the best
way, for while a
few skiers prefer
to make the heel
light and weight
it with lead,
there is no advantage
in doing
so.</p>

<p>The groove in
the exact center
of the running
surface should
now be cut in,
which is made
about ¹⁄₈ in. deep,
and ³⁄₈ to ¹⁄₂ in. in
width. A grooving
plane is most
convenient, but a
small gouge, if
carefully used,
will do as well.
The groove
should run from
the heel to the
beginning of the
bend.</p>

<p>To finish the
ski, sandpaper
top and bottom
smooth, and rub
down with linseed
oil to which
little paraffin, or beeswax, has been
added. The running surface of the ski
should be finished with oil and waxed,
and it is an advantage that the entire
ski be finished in the same manner, as
less snow will stick to the tops than
if varnish is used. The experienced
skier is more concerned about the running
qualities of his skis than the finish,
but the novice is more likely to be
attracted by fancy implements. When
varnished tops are wanted, a glossy
and durable surface is obtained by<span class="pagenum" id="Page30">[30]</span>
brushing on a couple of coats of good
spar varnish.</p>

<p>A tube, or cake, of wax should be
carried by every skier, for the running
surface must have numerous coatings
that the snow may not stick to the
wood. Both paraffin and beeswax are
suitable, and the skier may use one of
the several good preparations put up
in tubes and in cakes, or melt up his
own, as preferred. A good cake, or hard,
wax is made by melting up 10 oz. of
beeswax with 5 oz. of rosin. When
melted, stir in 1 oz. of turpentine and
pour in small boxes to form cakes of
convenient size.</p>

<p>The running surfaces are often
waxed by rubbing the wax on and then
going over the surfaces with a hot flatiron.
This is a good method, providing
only a sufficient quantity of wax
has been applied. A too liberal application
of wax cannot be called a disadvantage
when running downhill, but
it will make the runners so slippery
that climbing uphill is difficult.</p>

<p class="caption">Apparatus for Filling Toy Rubber Balloons with
Hydrogen Gas to Make Them Fly to
a Great Height</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Any boy can easily convert a toy
rubber balloon into a real flier by
constructing the simple device shown
in the illustration for filling it with hydrogen.
Procure a clay pipe and break
off the stem near the bowl. Bore a
hole in a cork, or preferably a rubber
stopper, selected to fit some bottle and
insert the smaller end of the pipestem
in the hole. As the stem tapers, if the
hole has been made for the smaller
end, a tight fit is assured by simply
pressing the stem well into the cork.
Tie the open end of the stem on the
balloon tightly over the larger end of
the pipestem, and have ready a thread
to tie the stem of the balloon when it
is filled.</p>

<p>Procure from a local drug store 1 oz.
of hydrochloric acid. Place some nails,
or better still, a few strips of zinc, in
the bottle and cover them with a little
water, then pour a small quantity of
the hydrochloric acid into the bottle
and assemble as shown in the illustration.
In a few minutes hydrogen
gas will be given off, and if the joints
are tight, the balloon will begin to fill.
After it has expanded as much as it will
stand without breaking, tie the end
with the thread, and cut off any parts
of the mouthpiece that may weigh it
down. If sufficient gas has been
passed into the balloon it will rise to
the ceiling. Balloons filled in this manner
have risen to a height of several
hundred feet.</p>

<p>Caution: Do not allow the hydrochloric
acid to come in contact with the
skin or clothing, as it may cause frightful
burns. Do not under any circumstance
fill the balloon near a flame or
allow fire to come near the bottle.—Contributed

<p>There seems to be a feeling among
mechanical and electrical experimenters
that there is something mysterious
about the process of wood finishing,
and often one may see a really fine piece
of apparatus spoiled by mounting it
on a shellacked baseboard. I have
found that it is a very simple matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[31]</span>
to produce almost a piano finish on all
woods, even those as soft as poplar, in
the following manner. Quick-drying
wood dyes should be avoided. Simply
rub down a piece of ordinary water-color
cake into some plain water and
apply freely with a rag, rubbing it in
well. Any color may be obtained in
this way, but if this is not convenient,
use an oil stain made quite thin with
turpentine. Next apply a thin coat of
shellac, which should be sandpapered
when it is dry. A coat of ordinary varnish
is then applied, and when this is
thoroughly dried, rub lightly with fine
steel wool. One coat of varnish may
be sufficient, although several coats
will produce a richer finish. Rub the
last coats down well with an oily rag
dipped in some abrasive material, such
as tooth powder or metal polish, and
finish with a simple oil rub. A beautiful,
soft, transparent effect may be
obtained in this way on very ordinary
woods. Any open-grained woods, such
as oak, must be filled with a paste filler
after staining.—Contributed by John

<p>In constructing the cabinet, the outer
frame should first be made. The sides
can be laid out and cut to the desired
design. The top and bottom crosspieces
should then be squared up, and
the tenons cut as shown, the bottom
tenons extending farther, to balance the
design. The top is set in ³⁄₄ in. from the
back edge. Holes should be marked
and cut for the ³⁄₄-in. keys, after which
the four parts may be assembled, and
suitable keys driven in place. The back
for the cabinet is made from ³⁄₄-in. material,
squared up to fit between the
sides, and be flush with their top edges
while resting on the bottom crosspiece.
It can be fastened in place with nails.
The top and bottom pieces of the cabinet
proper can then be made, and secured
in place with round-head screws,
after which the door may be made and
fitted. The stiles and rails of the door
should be rabbeted for a ³⁄₈-in. square
groove, to hold the panel in place. The
frame can be made sufficiently strong,
if properly glued and held together
with dowel pins passing through the
stiles into the rails. If it is desired to
fasten the frame with tenons, an extra
amount must be added to the length of
the rails given in the stock list. The
panel should not be glued in place, as
the shrinkage of the wood will cause it
to crack.</p>

<p>In making the drawers, the front
should be rabbeted for a groove to fit
the drawer bottom, and sidepieces can
be fitted and nailed in place. These
should be rabbeted for grooves, into
which the bottom and end pieces fit.</p>

<p>If the cabinet is finished in mission
style, or fumed oak, hammered copper
or brass hinges and drawer pulls will
go well with the general appearance of
the design.</p>

<p class="fauxh2">Part II</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">B</span><span class="afterlargecap">efore</span> the beginner makes the attempt
to ski, he should see that his
complete outfit is perfectly suited to his
purpose. The shoes should be nicely adjusted
to fit snugly between the metal
toe plates of the binding, and new
holes should be punched in the straps
wherever needed to adjust the harness
snugly and comfortably to the feet.
Many of the positions required in executing
the various turns and swings
may be practiced at home, that the
novice may get some idea of the correct
position of the feet and body assumed
by expert skiers. For the initial
practice outside, it is a good plan
to select a frosty day when the snow
is old and settled by the wind. This
will introduce the novice to the sport
under favorable conditions, while if the
first trials are made shortly after a
heavy snowfall, or upon a mild day
when the snow is thawing, only discouragement
will be experienced. Begin
with one stick—or two if timid—and
pick out an easy-sloping hill with
a gradual run to the level ground. A
few scattered trees and rocks will do
no harm, for it is a good plan to learn
how to avoid them from the beginning.</p>

<h3>How to Turn on Skis</h3>

<p>This and the correct manner of
standing on skis are easily mastered
if the beginner will but remember that
the weight of the body should rest
largely upon the advanced foot without
bending the body at the ankle too
much, or raising the heel from the ski.
This is the correct position to assume
when standing for a rest and for sliding,
and this as well as turning should
be practiced on the level. To make
the kick turn, simply raise the point of
the ski until the heel rests on the snow,
as shown in <a href="#Fig34">Fig. 1</a>. Swing the ski
around by turning the point out and
back until the two skis are point to
heel, as shown in <a href="#Fig34">Fig. 2</a>. When this,
the most difficult position of the three,
is assumed, raise the point of the other
ski as high as convenient to avoid tripping,
keep the heel down and swing
the ski around over the heel of the
other until both are facing in the same
direction, as shown in <a href="#Fig34">Fig. 3</a>. A little
practice will make it possible for the
novice to turn quickly, and if all turns
are made with the advanced foot, when
practicing on the level, no trouble will
be experienced later on in attempting
to turn on a steep slope. The stick is
really indispensable for this practice,
and while two may be used, the single
stick will be found assistance enough
for any active person.</p>

<p>When skiing on level ground the
correct movement is rather more of a
slide than the motion used in walking
or skating. The body is thrown forward
on one ski and the slide is made
with both feet, most of the body
weight being thrown on the advanced
ski, while the rear foot is slid forward
without stopping the forward travel,
as shown in <a href="#Fig34">Fig. 4</a>. The expert skier
moves forward in long gliding steps
without raising the ski, but bending
the knees slightly to slide the ski
ahead. The feet should be kept as
close together as possible to make a
narrow track and the stick used to
lengthen the slide. At the beginning
it is a good plan to endeavor to make
a long slide with each advancement of
the foot, rather than strive to take long<span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span>
steps. The speed
of level running
depends, of
course, upon the
condition of the snow. On hard, well-packed
snow, sliding is easiest and
greater speed obtained, while in deep
and soft snow less speed is the rule.
When skiing on the hard snow of a
road, four miles an hour is the average
speed, and for average level running,
the skier will cover about the
same distance as when walking along
a good path.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>When traveling uphill, the regular
sliding gait will suffice if the slope is
gradual, but when a steep grade is encountered
and the ski slips backward,
the skier stands quite erect, raises the
point of his ski about 3 in., and slaps
it down smartly, without pulling it
backward or making any attempt to
push his body forward with the stick.
This slap of the ski makes the smooth
surface of the runner adhere better
than when the runner is slid forward
in the usual manner. If the hill is
very steep, the skier will naturally
place his skis at right angles rather
than permit the slipping backward.
This is known as “side-stepping,” and
is shown in <a href="#Fig34">Fig. 5</a>. In doing this, the
heel of the ski must be raised clear of
the snow and the upper foot lifted uphill,
then the lower foot brought up to
the last step of the upper foot, hence it
is extremely tiring for other than a
short distance.</p>

<p>A variation of this movement, which
is known to skiers as the “half side
step.” and which is made by advancing
the foot with the legs somewhat
wider apart, and the skis placed
at not quite so
acute an angle
with the hill, is
more useful when
climbing the ordinary
steep grade
and is far less
laborious. If the
skier knows how
to handle his implements,<span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span>
side-stepping may be done
backward when necessary.</p>

<p>The “herringbone” is another step
which is much
used when the
skier wishes to
travel up a short
and steep incline.
This step is made
by stretching the
legs rather wide
apart and pointing
the toes out,
as shown in <a href="#Fig34">Fig. 6</a>,
at a decided angle,
so that the knees are
bent inward and the
inside edges of the skis cut into the
snow. A variation of this is the “half
herringbone,” the skis being turned
out at a less acute angle. These special
steps for special purposes are all
useful now and then in mountain
climbing, but when a long distance is
to be covered, the skier will conserve
his energy by mounting the hill in a
zigzag fashion rather than attempting
to climb straight up. The track of the
skier will then resemble the course of
a boat tacking through a narrow inlet
against a head of wind, and while
more ground is covered than when
going straight up the steepest part of
the hill, progress is faster and much
hard work is avoided.</p>

<p>When running straight downhill,
one ski should be in advance of the
other a few inches, and the skis must
be held quite close together so that
they touch, or nearly so, as shown in
<a href="#Fig34">Fig. 7</a>. To make a narrow track, most
expert skiers hold the knees together
with the back knee slightly bent. However,
the body should be perfectly and
easily balanced. This is done, more
or less, intuitively, by beginning the
run with the body thrown on the advanced
foot, and when full speed is attained
the weight automatically shifts
to the rear foot. The novice will find
it difficult at first to keep the skis together,
there being an almost uncontrollable
desire to separate them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span>
gain a better balance. A good track
will come with a little practice, but if
the skis are too short, or made without
a groove, even an expert would be
compelled to keep his feet a trifle
apart and make a double track in order
to keep from falling.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>When making the start preparatory
for coasting downhill, the novice may,
if the slope is moderately steep, face in
the desired direction and assume the
proper position by supporting himself
with the stick. On most very steep
slopes, where the best coasting is to be
had, this is quite out of the question,
and the skier must step around quickly
by moving the lower ski first. This
will be somewhat difficult to do until
the novice gains more confidence,
which will quickly come after a little
practice, and it is a good plan to practice
starting from the slope without
the aid of the stick to anchor the body.
Owing to the fact that the skis do not
reach much speed at the start of the
coast, even the slow novice will have
plenty of time to make the turn and
face in the right direction before much
speed is attained. A comparatively
crouching position, secured by bending
the knees and the body at the waist,
will much lessen the liability of a fall
forward. This position enables the
skier to control the balance of his body
with more certainty, and especially
when coasting on a hill where patches
of ice, or crusted snow, and soft spots
of unpacked snow are encountered, a
condition usually found wherever skiing
is enjoyed. When coasting, the
stick, or sticks, should be firmly
grasped at the upper end with the
looped thong, or strap, over the wrist,
and the end dragging behind. Balancing
is done entirely at the waist,
and for straightaway running, the
weight of the body will rest largely
upon the rear ski. The long running
surface of the ski will carry the skier
over many bumps and hollows without
disturbing the balance of the body or
causing a fall, providing the novice
does not lose his nerve. It is necessary
to practice on rough and uneven
ground if the skier desires ever to attain
much expertness, and plenty of
falls must be expected, but not dreaded
by the beginner. A fall on skis is by
no means fraught with danger, and one
may fall with impunity providing all
muscles are relaxed. Many beginners
find falling the easiest manner of
stopping, but this should not be necessary,
providing the hints given are
well understood and practiced. However,
the novice should have no fear of
falling if he wants to become proficient
on skis, and to offset any timidity,
which so very often causes the novice
to lean backward and fall in this direction,
it is a good plan to lean well forward
to check this natural tendency.
Getting up after a fall is easily enough
managed if the head is pointing up the
slope, but when the position is reversed
much floundering is necessitated. It
would seem that this would be obvious
to all, yet the majority of beginners
often forget it altogether.</p>

<p>Braking with the stick is only effective
when the body is properly balanced,
and the stick is kept well forward
and as nearly vertical as possible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span>
Straddling the stick, sitting upon it, or
leaning backward on it held at an
angle, are slovenly methods which
every novice should avoid.</p>

<p>The “snowplow” is most largely
used by all good skiers for braking,
stopping, and turning. This is accomplished
by stretching the legs wide
apart and at the same time turning the
toes in as much as possible, thus presenting
the side of the ski to the snow
and retarding the speed. Aside from
straddling the legs wide apart, the
novice will have no trouble in learning
this useful knack. For the first practice,
pick out a fairly steep hill road,
or a hillside where the snow is old and
not soft. Begin the run as for coasting,
and when good speed has been
attained, spread the legs wide apart,
turn the toes in and endeavor to control
the speed with the skis rather than
depend upon the stick. On hard snow
the edges of the ski may be used to
check the speed, but on ordinary soft
and well-packed snow, the runner may
be kept quite flat. This is well shown
in <a href="#Fig34">Fig. 8</a>.</p>

<p>The knack of “stemming” is a variation
of the snowplow, inasmuch as
the skier runs straight downhill on one
ski, and turns the heel of the other ski
outward and downward and uses it as
a brake, as in <a href="#Fig34">Fig. 9</a>. This is a very
useful movement, and is largely used
when coasting down steep slopes, and
when one has learned the knack of it,
stemming will serve for braking and
steering, and is useful for stopping by
turning the skiing course uphill. To
earn it, select a steep hillside, coast
down at an angle, with the feet a trifle
part, and endeavor to retard the speed
with the stick and turn the heel of the
lower ski outward. This makes the
turn and the skier faces uphill and
comes to a stop. By turning the heel
of the lower ski outward and the heel
of the upper ski inward, the skis will
travel downhill with a sort of snowplow
movement. When practicing
these movements, the beginner should
endeavor to use the stick as little as
possible and learn to depend upon the
skis for controlling the speed.</p>

<p>The “side slip” is useful on steep
slopes, and is done by turning the skis
so that the runners are at a
decided angle to the course
traveled. This affords the
maximum braking by the
skis alone, and is especially
effective when combined
with the braking done with
the stick. Side-slipping may,
of course, be done while the skier is
traveling forward, by keeping the skis
close together so that the edges almost
touch. While this movement checks
the speed in much the same manner as
stemming, side-slipping is less tiresome,
since the weight of the body
gives the required braking effect, while,
in stemming, the muscles are called
upon to keep the heel pressing outward.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 11</span><br>
The Swing is Made upon
One Ski Instead of
Using Both as in the
Christiania Swing</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Closely akin to side-slipping is the
Christiania swing with the stick, which
is accomplished by pressing with
both heels at the same time, while
the stick digs well into the snow above.
This variation of the side slip is easily
done, and the skier is turned sharply<span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span>
uphill to come to a quick stop. When
a sharp hill is met with, that is considered
a bit too steep to take straight,
this swing with
the stick may be
made by taking a zigzag course
down grade steering clear of any
obstacles by snowplowing, stemming,
or side-slipping; and turning the corners,
or “tacking,” by making use of
the Christiania swing and the stick, as
shown in <a href="#Fig36">Fig. 10</a>.</p>

<p>The “S”-turn may likewise be used
for turning corners, without the necessity
for stopping to make the ordinary
kick turn. A good way to learn this
useful movement is to run straight
downhill in a snowplow position, reduce
the speed to a comfortable walking
pace with the stick, and stem with
the ski. If this is done with the right
ski, the “S”-turn is made by throwing
practically the whole weight of the
body on the right ski, at the heel, and
pressing it outward while the stick is
carried ahead and below the skier. If
the heels are kept well apart, and the
toes close together, the skier will have
no trouble about swinging around in
a curve and be off on the other tack.
About the only difficulty in making the
“S”-turn is the position of the body,
which must be thrown somewhat out
and away from the hill. To the novice
this at first seems to invite a fall, but a
few trials will soon prove that the
weight of the body must be thrown on
the foot which circles on the outside
of the curve, hence the apparently unnatural
position of the body is essential
for a good turn. By bringing the stick
well forward and downhill, the skier
uses his staff as a pivot upon which
the turn is made.</p>

<p>The Christiania swing, made without
the stick, is a favorite with expert
ski runners when running on rough
and steep ground and is a good way
of stopping. The swing may be made
both to the right and left. To make it
to the right, keep the skis close together,
the right a trifle in advance,
with the weight of the body equally
on both feet and with knees slightly
bent. Now throw the weight more
forward and upon
the toes, while
the heels are carried
forward and
outward to the
left. The body must lean to the right—the
direction in which the swing is
made—and twisted somewhat at the
waist; and the sharper the turn, the
more the body must lean sideways to
keep the balance. The swing to the
left is made in the, same fashion, only
the left ski should be a trifle advanced
and the body thrown to the left.</p>

To Make the Jump the
Skier Assumes the Easy
Position Required for
Coasting Downhill</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The Telemark swing is more difficult
to master than the Christiania swing,
because it is done on one foot, or ski,
instead of using both, and as it is less
powerful than the latter, it is of far less
use for stopping. To make the Telemark
swing to the right, assume the
regular position for downhill coasting,
and, advancing the left foot, turn the
ski so that it rests on its edge as when
making the snowplow, throw the body
to the right and lean in toward the
slope to keep the balance. To make the
swing to the left, advance the right
foot, turn the body to the left and lean
as before. This is shown in <a href="#Fig37">Fig. 11</a>.
The Telemark turn is, in fact, made in
the same manner as stemming, and the
sharpness of the swing rests altogether
upon the quickness with which the
heel is thrown outward and the body
turned in the direction the skier desires
to swing. The swing is made
upon one ski, and the key to the whole
swing is the knack of raising the heel
of the other foot off its ski until it rests
upon the toes. That this is hard to do
goes with the telling, and the novice
should first acquire the knack of balancing<span class="pagenum" id="Page39">[39]</span>
by running straight downhill
with the weight thrown on one foot.
When this can be done, and not before
then, the skier is ready to practice the
turn. The Telemark swing, like all
other turns, is easily acquired at slow
and moderate speeds, and becomes
more and more difficult to make as the
speed is increased and the turn is made
more sharply and quickly.</p>

<p>Jumping on skis is one of the most
exhilarating winter sports, and it is a
pity that it is not more popular wherever
a medium-heavy fall of snow occurs.
While touring on skis across a
hilly country, there will be many natural
jumps to encounter, for drifts,
stumps, rocks, and other rises in the
ground, when well covered and padded
with snow, make good jumping-off
places. While but a few skiers may
have attempted such high leaps as the
famous Holmenkollen, Fiskertorpet, or
Foldberg, all who have done much ski
running have done a little jumping,
since, when running downhill, an unexpected
dip is often encountered, and
a rise in the ground causes the skier to
leave the ground for a short distance
and alight several feet below. Doubtless
the skier has enjoyed the flying-like
sensation of this brief moment,
and very likely he has climbed the hill
to repeat the jump. Moreover, this
has very likely demonstrated that the
distance of the jump depends upon
the height of the dip, the speed of the
skier passing over it, and likewise upon
the spring of the body on the take-off.
In making a jump of any height, the
take-off may be level, pointing up or
even downhill, and constructed with
framework extending out from the
hillside, or consist merely of a large
boulder, or a pile of logs, well padded
with snow. The height of the slope
chosen will, of course, regulate the distance
of the jump, and the place where
the jumper alights should be fairly
steep, since, if the skier lands upon a
level place great difficulty will be experienced
in keeping the balance,
therefore the usual jumping hill, where
jumping competitions are held, is provided
with a 30°, or steeper, landing
place, and this merges gradually into
the outrun, or slope, connecting the
hill with the level ground below.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 13</span><br>
Each Member of the Party should be Provided with
a Ruck Sack of Good Capacity</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>For the safety of the skier, the snow
should be firm but not icy or hard,
and this is easily done by packing the
snow down well by means of the skis.
A good, thick padding of snow is of
course essential, and a thickness of 2 ft.
is really needed at the landing place
and at the take-off. In our more northerly
sections, plenty of snow usually
falls, but wherever a few sportsmen get
together, it is an easy matter to shovel
sufficient snow to prepare a good and
safe jumping hill.</p>

<p>To gain confidence and acquire some
useful experience in jumping, the
novice should practice leaping from a
2-ft. rise and gradually increase the
height of the take-off by piling more
snow upon it to increase its height.
One or two packing cases firmly placed
upon a smooth, steep hillside, and well
padded with 2 ft. of well-trodden snow,
will make a nice take-off. For the beginning
the take-off may point slightly
downhill or be fashioned level, and as
the skier becomes more proficient,
snow may be added to the edge so that
the take-off will send the jumper well
up into the air.</p>

<p>The knack of jumping is nothing
more than balancing the body upon
alighting, and the steeper the landing
place the easier it is to keep the balance.
To make the jump in good form,
the skier assumes the easy position required
for coasting downhill, as shown
in <a href="#Fig38">Fig. 12</a>. When within a dozen yards
of the take-off the body is lowered until
the skier is in a crouching position with
the arms extending back as in the act
of jumping. Arriving within a couple<span class="pagenum" id="Page40">[40]</span>
of yards of the dip the body and arms
are thrown forward, which transfers
the weight of the body upon the toes,
and the body is straightened up and
the arms are raised not unlike the
wings of a bird, to keep the perfect balance
of the body. The straightening
up of the body, known to skiers as “the
sats,” is the leap proper and must be
timed so that the body assumes an
erect position when the jumper is not
less than 12 ft. from the edge of the
take-off. The beginner will invariably
jump too late, but after a little practice,
and profiting by numerous mistakes,
the take-off will be timed correctly.
Alighting after a jump is best done by
advancing one ski a trifle to keep the
balance, and bending the knees a bit
to lessen the impact. The jumper ends
with the Telemark or Christiania
swing.</p>

<p>When taking tours of any length on
skis, each member of the party should
be provided with a ruck sack of good
capacity. That of the expanding type,
made with two outside pockets, and
with gores at the sides, is a good, sensible
pack. It should be made of
8-oz. waterproof khaki and fitted with
shoulder straps of good width, to prevent
chafing the shoulders. Leather
ruck sacks are sometimes used, but are
heavier in weight and more expensive
but no better. One member of the
party should carry some kind of repairing
outfit, consisting of an awl, a length
of leather thong, a few spare straps
and a stout cord, or string. These
sacks are shown in <a href="#Fig39">Fig. 13</a>.</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>In looking forward to the enjoyment
that may be had in the spring, it is well
to prepare and overhaul the fishing apparatus
or the shooting equipment. In
doing so, it may be necessary to make
a joint for the fish rod or perhaps a rod
for the gun. These can be easily cut if
they are sized and run through holes
made in a piece of thin metal as follows:
Make several holes of the desired
sizes in a steel plate, and ream them
out with a rather dull taper reamer, so
as to leave a bur on one side. This bur
should be filed down almost level with
the surface of the metal, leaving the
edges flat and sharp. If a rod of wood
from which the article is to be made is
put in a hole and drawn through from
the opposite side to the bur, a nice
round rod will result. As the rod becomes
smaller, use a smaller hole until
the required diameter is obtained. A
saw plate that is not too thin is about
the proper thing to use for the steel
plate. It will be necessary to draw the
temper to make the holes, but it is not
necessary to retemper it after the holes
are made.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A Compact Galvanometer</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>A small portable galvanometer is one
of the most useful instruments to the
electrical experimenter. There are continually
arising instances where it is
necessary to test through and identify
certain wires, for which purpose a small
galvanometer and a dry cell are quite
sufficient. For comparing the resistances
by the well-known Wheatstone-bridge
method, a galvanometer is, of
course, indispensable. If the winding
is made suitable, or by placing a shunt
across the terminals to reduce the deflection,
a small galvanometer will
roughly indicate the current passing
and thus enable one to compare his dry
cells and eliminate the weak ones.
Rough voltage comparisons may also
be made by placing a resistance in series
with the galvanometer.</p>

<p>For constructing this instrument, a
good pocket compass, of about 2-in.
diameter, must be procured. Prepare a
neat little box with the four edges accurately
beveled off. On the under side
of this, carefully cut a channel, about
¹⁄₂ in. wide and 2¹⁄₂ in. long, to a depth
that will bring the bottom of the slot
within ¹⁄₈ in. of the top of the base
block. Place two binding posts on the
base, as indicated, and secure the compass
in place with cement, or by two
very small nails put through the bottom.
If the glass cannot be removed,
it will be necessary to solder the nail
heads to the bottom of the compass
box, after having carefully removed the
lacquer.</p>

<p>The correct wiring will depend on
the strength of the current handled. It
is, however, very easy to get an idea of
what the deflection will be under certain
conditions by merely making a
preliminary trial, after winding a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span>
turns of any magnet or bell wire at
hand around a small piece of wood, and
slipping the coil so formed into the slot
on the under side of the base block.
The winding may be from two or three
turns of heavy wire up to several hundred
turns of fine magnet wire, but
after one or two trials, the maker will
have no trouble in determining his particular
requirements.</p>

<p class="caption">Galvanometer Made of a Compass Set on a Wood

<p>The final coil should be wound
lengthwise on a wood core, and the
whole packed neatly into the slot.
Connect up the ends to the binding
posts, and then glue in a thin piece to
hold the coil in place.</p>

<p>By drilling a small horizontal hole
through the base, as indicated by the
two dotted lines in the top view of the
working drawings, and inserting a
small bar magnet, ¹⁄₈ in. in diameter, or
less, the instrument may be rendered
independent of the earth’s magnetism
and used without reference to the north
point. Such a controlling magnet reduces
the time required to bring the
needle to rest after it has been violently
reflected.</p>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">S</span><span class="afterlargecap">portsmen</span> are interested in
rifles and rifle shooting largely
from the hunting standpoint, although
target shooting is a favorite sport with
many of them. This discussion of the
sporting rifle will be concerned, therefore,
principally with the hunting aspects,
other forms of shooting being
considered as good methods of practice,
and the development of skill in
the use of hunting weapons. The
novice, as well as the good shot, must
have a suitable weapon, and should
have at least a general knowledge of
the types of rifles available, and their
common uses. A number of representative
types of rifles are shown in <a href="#Fig48">Fig.
1</a>, and the details of the breech mechanisms
and sights in <a href="#Fig51a">Fig. 2</a>. Targets
and a homemade device for backing
them are shown in <a href="#Fig51b">Fig. 3</a>. The <a href="#Fig49">full-page
illustration</a> shows several positions
in the use of the rifle; a moving-target
arrangement, to be constructed
by the ambitious shot; a diagram of
the trajectory of a rifle bullet, and several
diagrams of the vital shots, in
hunting common big game.</p>

<p>The single-shot rifle, shown at A,
<a href="#Fig48">Fig. 1</a>, has been largely supplanted by
the repeater and the automatic, so far
as hunting is concerned. For use exclusively
in indoor shooting, a heavy
rifle of the “Schuetzen” type is best
suited. A high-grade ornamented rifle
of this type is shown in the headpiece
of this article.</p>

<p>The most popular type of American
rifle is the repeater of the lever-action
variety, shown at B. The lever action
embodies many good points: quickness
of fire, ease of operation, freedom
from jamming at a critical moment,
strength, and plenty of stopping power.
The mechanism of the lever-action repeating
rifle is shown in detail at J,
<a href="#Fig51a">Fig. 2</a>, and that of the falling-breech-block
type of single-shot rifle, at K.
Several other types of lever-action
rifles are shown in <a href="#Fig48">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p>Almost all lever-action repeaters are
of the tubular-magazine type, the
magazine extending under the barrel,
sometimes the full length—full magazine;
or halfway—half magazine.
Rifles of these types are shown at B
and C, and a hammerless repeater at D.</p>

<p>The trombone, or pump-action, repeating
rifle, shown at E, has a mechanism
similar to that used in the repeating
shotgun, the sliding forearm
loading and ejecting the cartridge.
The merit of the military bolt-action
rifle lies in its great strength and
simplicity. A weapon of this type was
used by Roosevelt in Africa, and by
other big-game hunters. It is shown
at F.</p>

<p>The chief advantages of the automatic
rifle, shown at G, which is a
comparatively new weapon, are its
speed in firing and its almost noiseless
action. This rifle has a recoil-operated
action of the blow-back type. That
shown at H has a box magazine, and
the automatic action is based on the
sliding of the barrel within a steel
jacket. The rifle shown at I may be
used either as an automatic or as a
pump-action weapon.</p>

<p>The subject of stock and trigger adjustment
is one to which every experienced
rifleman devotes considerable attention.
The regular stock rifle is built
to standard dimensions, and often the
stock is found a trifle short. For the
man of average reach, a 13³⁄₄-in. stock,
with a 1⁷⁄₈-in. drop at the comb, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span>
about 3 in. drop at the heel, will be
found satisfactory.</p>

<p>Rifle sights are of several types, of
which there are in turn many variations.
Only the essentials of the standard
types will be considered. The
regulation open sights, with which
most rifles are fitted at the factory, are
the buckhorn rear and the Rocky
Mountain front sight. For a hunting
rifle the most satisfactory sights are
a gold-bead front sight of about ³⁄₃₂-in.
diameter, as shown in <a href="#Fig51a">Fig. 2</a> at L; a
folding-leaf rear sight, shown at O, P,
and Q, and a combination rear aperture
sight, at M and N, mounted on
the tang of the rifle. An arm so
sighted is useful for all kinds of shooting.
The combination rear sight is
used in deliberate shots at a target or
at game, and the folding-leaf sight is
better than the buckhorn for quick
snap shooting.</p>

<p>The sportsman who wishes to master
the use of a rifle must have a knowledge
of the trajectory of such weapons,
and particularly of the rifle he uses regularly.
He must know, also, how to
aline the sights correctly to get satisfactory
results. The trajectory is the
path which the rifle bullet takes in
passing from the muzzle of the rifle
to its mark. The force of gravity acts
upon the bullet in flight and the result
is that the trajectory is curved, as indicated
in the diagram at the bottom
of the page illustration. A relatively
low trajectory is, of course, desirable
in a hunting rifle. The black-powder,
or slow-speed, cartridge has a relatively
high trajectory, while the high-power
smokeless cartridges have relatively
low trajectories.</p>

<p>The adjustment of the sights of a
rifle is also of much importance.
Every rifle is targeted at the factory,
but this may be done by a fair shot,
using the following method: Arrange
three boxes, so that the rifle barrel
may rest upon one, and the arms of
the marksman upon the other two.
Place a bag of sand upon the box, so
that the barrel may rest upon it, about
6 in. from the muzzle. Put the target
into place, and adjust the sights for 100
yd. If the sights are properly lined
up, the shots should fall quite regularly
within a 10-in. circle. With peep, or
other target, sights, much finer results
will be obtained. In moving the sights
it must be remembered that to move
the rear sight to the right will bring
the shot to the right, and vice versa,
while if the front sight is moved to the
right, the arm will shoot to the left.
In making the test, first adjust the
front sight so that it is in exact alinement
with the center of the barrel, and
then all corrections may be made by
moving the rear sight.</p>

<p>The proper way to sight a rifle is to
hold the front sight just clear of the
notch in the rear sight, with the front
bead barely touching the outer ring of
the bull’s-eye, at the extreme bottom.
This is shown at R, <a href="#Fig51b">Fig. 3</a>. It is the
rule of good rifle shot to “see daylight
between the sight and the bull’s-eye.”
In any event, do not cover up the front
sight by drawing it down into the
notch of the rear sight, so that only
the top of the bead is visible. Another
frequent error is to hold the front sight
to cover the bull’s-eye.</p>

<p class="caption long">The Off-Hand, Knee-Support, and Prone Positions in Shooting should be Mastered by the Sportsman.
The Diagrams Represent Several Vital Shots, the Moving Target, and
the Trajectory of a Rifle Bullet</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page50">[50]</span></p>

<p>The sportsman who wishes to become
a practical rifle shot should learn
how to handle the rifle in the several
useful positions, so that he may be able
to sight accurately under different conditions.
Several of the most widely
used positions are shown in the page
illustration. The off-hand position,
with arm extended, is the most commonly
used and best position for the
sportsman to practice, for use in the
woods. The off-hand, with body rest,
or elbow resting on the hip, is good for
target shooting. The “Schuetzen”
style of holding the rifle, with palm
rest, is used only in fine match
shooting.</p>

<p>The knee-rest position is often useful
for the sportsman in stalking game,
when it is desirable to expose oneself
as little as possible. A steadier aim
may be secured, especially if a strong
wind is blowing. The prone position
is much used by military riflemen, but
they are not permitted the muzzle rest,
whereas the hunter often uses it. It
is easy to learn, and more accurate
shooting may be done in this position
than in the off-hand or knee-rest
positions.</p>

<p>For indoor practice at a target, the
.22-caliber rifle is best. By fitting up
a suitable backstop, shooting may be
done safely in the cellar or attic. A
satisfactory backstop may be made by
fastening a plate of iron into a packing
box, 3 ft. square, as shown in <a href="#Fig51b">Fig.
3</a>. The plate must be set at an angle
so that the bullets will be deflected to
the bottom of the box.</p>

<p>In order that the rifleman may check
up his work, it is desirable that a standard
target be used. The American
standard target, shown in <a href="#Fig51b">Fig. 3</a>, has
been adopted by practically all rifle
clubs, and, as the majority of records
are made upon it, the sportsman should
become familiar with it. The paper
targets are inexpensive, and it is easy
to draw accurate homemade targets
from the original. By the use of disks
of black and white paper—known as
gummed target pasters—one target
may be used several times.</p>

<p>If convenient to do so, the novice
should shoot a string of shots every
day, in the various positions. Do not
try to hurry, but shoot deliberately at
first, aiming to secure a good average,
rather than a few bull’s-eye shots and
many wild ones. With reasonable
practice, it is not difficult to score eight
bull’s-eyes out of ten shots, when using
the prone position. Having attained
this proficiency, the sportsman may be
regarded as a fair shot, and is ready to
take up outdoor target practice with
the high-power rifle.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>For outdoor target shooting the .22-caliber,
long-rifle cartridge will give
very accurate results up to 100 yd.
The standard target has a bull’s-eye
measuring 6 in. in diameter for 150 yd.
Shooting may be tried for a while at a
fixed range, then the target may be
moved to an unknown distance and
angle, and the marksman can try his
hand at estimating distance. Instead
of changing his sights at varying distances,
the sportsman should learn how
to estimate the distance of the mark
and the approximate elevation of the
sights to land the bullet within the
circle. This is valuable practice for
good shooting in the woods.</p>

<p>After considerable practice at the
stationary target, quick firing may be
varied by rigging up a sliding trolley
arrangement, like that shown in the
<a href="#Fig49">page illustration</a>. It is easily made by
setting up two poles, properly braced,
one about 30 ft. tall, and the other
about 10 ft., spaced 30 ft. apart. Between
the poles, about 8 ft. from the
ground, stretch a length of stiff telephone
wire, and make a wooden target
block W, with a metal sheave wheel,
so that it may slide freely along the
wire. On the tallest post, a little above
the wire, fasten a metal pulley, Z, and
at the top of the pole place a sash
pulley. Then attach a stout cord to<span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span>
the target block, reeve it through the
two pulleys, and attach a sandbag, or
other weight, to the end of the cord,
On the shorter post, a latch, or trigger,
Y, is fastened to hold the target, which
is released by pulling a string. With
this easily constructed device, much
valuable practice may be had, for if the
pole is fairly high, the weight will
cause the target to slide as rapidly as
the average game bird travels. In
using this moving target, just as good
practice is obtained with a .22-caliber
repeater as with a high-power gun. In
fact, the high-velocity ammunition
should be used only on a regular range,
or where a suitable backstop is erected
to stop the high-power bullets. Such
a backstop may be constructed of heavy
lumber, like old railroad ties, in the
form of a crib, which is filled in with
sand or earth. When a natural background,
such as a mound or hill, is at
hand, this may be used with safety, but
a rocky hillside is not satisfactory, for
it is likely to deflect the bullets, and
may cause injury through stray shots.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>As our antlered game, like the
moose, the Virginia deer, the caribou,
and the elk, are held in higher esteem
than other American big-game animals,
a few practical hints on where to sight,
may serve to bring better luck to the
sportsman who has yet to bring in his
first head. The shoulder shot, shown
in the <a href="#Fig49">rectangular sketch</a> at S, T and
U, is taken by the experienced hunter
whenever possible, in preference to any
other. It is the object of this shot to
break the shoulder joint, and thus prevent
use of the forelegs. It is a vital
shot, also, because there is a good
chance of the bullet passing through
either the heart or lungs, which will
drop the game in its tracks. This is
the most effective of all shots, and as
the hunter more often draws a bead
while the game is running away, the
shoulder shot is used more than any
other. The exact spot, at which the
aim should be taken, depends upon the
distance of the animal, and its rate of
movement. If on the run and the range
of 100 yd. or more, the sight should
be taken at the point S. If less than
this distance, sight at T, and, if the
animal is standing still, take deliberate
aim at U, within the dotted inclosure.
This area represents what big-game
hunters call the vital zone, and a soft-nose
bullet, placed anywhere within
this spot, will be certain to stop the
game, often dropping it on the spot.
It is possible to
land a bullet in a
vital spot at distances
up to 500
yd. with a high-power
rifle, but
it is very likely
that the game
will be wounded
only, and may
escape to die a
lingering death.
In taking long
shots at big
game on the run, the sight should be
taken well forward and a trifle higher
than the marks given, since the hunter<span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span>
must allow for the trajectory of his
arm and the time the bullet takes to
reach its mark.</p>

<p>The front shot, shown at the right,
has as its object to hit the heart or
lungs. It is a useful shot, and the sight
is taken at the cross indication on the
breast. The head shot, shown in the
circle, is a brain shot, and is used only
by the experienced hunter, when it is
difficult to land a shoulder or front
shot. As the brain is well up to the
top of the head, the best point of aim
is shown at V, midway between the
eyes and a trifle higher than their centers.
This shot is most effective when
the hunter stands a trifle above the
game, or shoots when the game is
charging head down. If on a level, aim
just above the eye, and if close to the
game, land the bullet just below the
eye. The ear shot, as indicated by the
cross, is taken at close quarters, and
the point to sight for is the inside of
the ear at its base.</p>

<p>A good rifle will give a lifetime of
service, and the sportsman should take
care of it. The best time to clean a
firearm of any kind is as soon after
shooting as possible, for the powder
residue is then fresh and moist, and is
more easily and quickly removed.
Black powder can be removed with a
wet rag, but smokeless powder not
only leaves a little powder residue, but
also a film of gummy residue on the
steel which is not apparent to the eye.
Common washing soda, dissolved in
water to make a saturated solution, is
used to remove it. Any of the ready-prepared
nitro solvents are good for
cleaning the rifle. A good way to clean
a rifle is to use strips of cotton flannel,
cut into squares of such size that they
will fit snugly, but may be easily
pushed through the barrel on the head
of the metal cleaning rod. Always
clean a rifle from the breech, if possible,
by resting the muzzle on a few
folded papers on the floor. Push a
couple of dry wipers down to the floor
to remove the carbon residue. Then
saturate another square of cloth with
the nitro solvent, and carefully swab
out the barrel, turning the rod so that
it will follow the spiral rifling. Repeat
the operation two or three times; then
take a clean wiper, moistened with the
solvent, and repeat until the barrel is
well lubricated with the cleaning fluid.
The barrel should be well oiled with
any good, thick oil, or liquid vaseline.
The lock mechanism of the arm should
be kept clean and very lightly lubricated
with any good thin oil, and the
gunstock polished with linseed oil.</p>

<h2 class="lrgr nobreak">Camera for Taking Pictures from a Kite<br>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> CHARLES I. REID</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">W</span><span class="afterlargecap">hen</span> watching a kite flying at
a considerable height one frequently
wonders how the landscape
appears from such a viewpoint as
would be possible from a kite. Few of
us can have the experience of a ride in
an aeroplane, but it is quite possible
to obtain a view from the kite, by proxy
as it were, through the use of a kite
camera. A kite of large dimensions
would be necessary to carry an ordinary
camera taking pictures of fair
size, hence it is necessary to devise one
of lighter construction, so that a kite of
moderate size may carry it to a height
of several hundred feet. Such a camera
is shown in the <a href="#Fig53">illustration</a> attached
to a box kite. Details of construction
are shown in the smaller <a href="#Fig53">sketches</a>.</p>

<p>A camera consists, briefly, of a light-proof
box, with a lens at one end and a
sensitive plate or film at the other.
For a kite camera, a single achromatic
lens will suit the purpose. Such a lens
is not expensive and may be taken from
a small camera. It must be obtained
before the camera is begun, since the
size of the latter is dependent upon the
focal length of the lens and the size of
the picture to be made. A camera taking
pictures 2 in. square is satisfactory
for kite photography, and if it is desired
to enlarge the pictures, this may
be done in the usual manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span></p>

<p>The box of the camera is made cone-shaped
in order to reduce the weight
and air resistance. Its sides are of
light-weight, stiff cardboard, reinforced
at the corners to insure that no light
will enter. The back of the camera
is a tight-fitting cover of cardboard,
having the same measurements as the
picture to be taken. The lens is fitted
to an intermediate partition, as shown
in the sketch. It is necessary to determine
the focal length of the lens
and to set it at a distance from the inner
side of the cardboard back of the
camera—the film surface—so that it
will focus properly for photographing
distant objects.</p>

<div class="container w45emmax" id="Fig53">

<p class="caption long">The Kite Camera Offers a Diversion in Photography,

The Camera Shown Is of Light Weight, Simple Construction,
and Produces Film Exposures Two Inches
Square. A Sectional View of Its Construction is
Given at the Left, and the Details of the Shutter
Device at the Right</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The front is provided with a circular
opening of a size large enough not
to obstruct the view of the lens. A
shutter made of thin pressboard is fitted
over the opening, as shown in the
sketch at the right. A slit is cut in the
shutter through which light is admitted
in making the exposure as the shutter
is drawn back. The size and width
of the slit regulates the exposure, and
a few trials must be made to determine
the most suitable speed of exposure for
the lens used. The shutter is pivoted
at its lower end and drawn back by a
rubber band. A string, to which a time
fuse is attached, controls the releasing
of the shutter to make the exposure.
The string holds the shutter closed
against the pull of the rubber band until
the fuse burns up to the string, severing
it. The fuse must be long enough to
enable the kite to attain a suitable
height before the string is burned.
When the shutter has been set, and the
fuse attached ready for lighting, the

room for loading. A piece of film, cut
to the proper size, is placed carefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page54">[54]</span>
into the light-proof sliding cover, as
with a film pack, the sensitive side, of
course, being placed nearest the lens.</p>

<p>The camera is attached to the kite
securely at the middle, as shown, so
that when the kite is in flight a view
nearly straight down will be obtained.
When all is in readiness the fuse is
lighted and the kite started on its
flight. By timing experimental flights,
the required length of fuse may be determined
in order to permit the kite to
attain the desired height at the time of
exposure.</p>

<p>The kite used for taking pictures
from the air should be large enough to
carry the kite easily. One of the box
type illustrated is satisfactory, although
other types may be used. A
kite camera for the amateur has great
possibilities for experimentation, but
requires care in construction and a reasonable
knowledge of photography. To
the person willing to master the details,
kite photography offers a pleasurable
diversion as well as practical uses
in photographing plots of ground,
groups of buildings, manufacturing
plants, and other subjects which cannot
be photographed by other methods.</p>

<p>In mixing paint, or paste, it is desirable

the nails 1 in. from the end.
Place similar nails on the other two
sides, spacing them to offset those on

<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> STILLMAN TAYLOR</span><br>
<span class="partname">PART I—How a Shotgun is Made</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">H</span><span class="afterlargecap">unting</span> and fishing have always
held the most important places in
the field of sport. Primitive man was
an expert hunter and a skilled fisherman.
He had to be in order to secure
food and skins, and while but few men
are now dependent upon this method of
getting a living, the call of the outdoor
world is still heard by millions of men
and women. This, then, may be reckoned
the inheritance which our primitive
ancestors have bequeathed to
every man, and every man will find
health and recreation through it. It
would be interesting to begin this chapter
at the start and set down the history
of weapons, trace the evolution of the
hunting arm all the way from the bow
down to the modern hammerless shotgun,
but as this is a practical article
on how to pick out a good gun and the
knack of using it, only modern weapons
will be discussed. While the novice
need not know the detailed process of
constructing a shotgun, he will find it
an advantage to know something of
the way in which a serviceable weapon
is manufactured, for with this knowledge
he is better qualified to pick out a
suitable arm for his own particular use.</p>

<p class="caption">The Side-Plate Lock Is a Development of the Old
Hammer Lock with Striker Inside</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The frame of a shotgun—that is, the
part to one end of which the barrels
are affixed, the stock being bolted to
the other—contains the lock mechanism,
and that the weapon may give the
most satisfaction for many years, the
stock must be of good quality, of the
exquisite temper, and the bolting
mechanism—securing the barrels to
the frame—must be simple, yet strong
and serviceable. For the frame, a solid
drop forging is milled to make a shell
into which the working mechanism is
fitted, and two types of frames are used
in making the modern shotguns. The
side-plate lock is really a development
of the old hammer lock, with the
striker inside. This lock is preferred
by some shooters because of its neat
and graceful lines, and some manufacturers
use this type because it enables
them to make use of a lighter
frame.</p>

<p class="caption">The Cocking Hook Is an Ingenious Device, with

</div><!--container-->

<p>The box type of frame likewise has
its champions and possesses certain
advantages. Certainly it makes a
strong and rigid frame, and for inexpensive
weapons it would be difficult
to improve upon. While its square,
boxlike form is not graceful in line, it
enables the maker to use a spiral, or
coil, spring instead of a flat spring for
operating the locks, which is an advantage.
In brief, the merits of both types
may be summed up in this fashion: The
use of the box type of lock enables the
maker to turn out a better quality of<span class="pagenum" id="Page56">[56]</span>
gun at a low price, but in the case of
a well-made gun, selling for a reasonable
figure, there is very little choice
between them so far as dependability
and long service are concerned. Both
are much used by manufacturers of the
finest weapons, hence the shooter may
pick out the one which best suits his
fancy.</p>

<h3>The Cocking Mechanism of the Hammerless</h3>

<p>The locks of the hammerless shotgun
work inside of the frame or lock, and
are cocked by an ingenious little mechanism
operated by the movement of
the barrels when they are opened. The
Anson &amp; Deely cocking mechanism is
one of the oldest and best of these devices,
and is still used on many American
as well as European arms. The
levers of this mechanism are hung with
pivots in the end of the frame—one end
projecting into the fore end and the
opposite end resting beneath the hammer
toe. As the gun is “broken,”
or opened, it presses down the forward
end of the cocking lever, and
the other end rises and pushes the hammers
into the cocked position. This is
the principle upon which all cocking
devices are constructed, and while it
works smoothly and is so simple that
it is not likely to get out of order, it
is mechanically weak, owing to the
short frame required to secure adequate
leverage. Perhaps one of the best variations
of the Anson &amp; Deely device is
one employed by an American manufacturer
who makes use of a rod running
through the frame from the fore
end to the hammer. To each end of
this rod is attached a crank, so hung
that as one crank is depressed the other
rises and pushes the hammer to the
cock position as the barrels are swung
to open the gun.</p>

<div class="container w50emmax">

<img src="images/illo060b.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">A Lug is Forged on the End of Each Barrel, and
When Fitted Together They are Brazed</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The cocking hook is an ingenious device
found on American shotguns and
many variations of it are, of course, used
on the different makes of arms. The
Parker gun is provided with a hook
working a slide, thus pulling the hammers
to cock. In the Baker, a bent arm
is pivoted to the breech to serve the
same purpose. Another example of
American ingenuity may be noted in
the lug-cocking devices used on the
Ithaca and Fox guns. This simple arrangement
is made by connecting the
toe of the hammer directly with the
lug, which is an integral part of the
barrel. The hammer is thus made to
act as its own lever, for as the toe portion
rises when the barrel is opened,
the striker falls back until it is caught
in the notch of the sear.</p>

<p>To guard against the possibility of
accidental discharge of the hammerless
gun, in which type of gun the hammer
must be always at full cock, a safety
trigger bolt is utilized. This bolt is
affixed in the frame in a vertical position
by pivoting it, and to the upper
part of the lever is attached a slide
placed on top of the tang immediately
back of the top lever which opens the
barrels. As this safety slide is pushed,
the lower end of the lever is brought
close up against the triggers, blocking
them, and thus prevents them from
moving while the safety is in the “on”
position. To discharge the gun, the
slide must be pushed forward to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page57">[57]</span>
“off” position, which moves the lower
end away from the triggers. This type
of safety is of the nonautomatic variety
and can only block the triggers
when the slide is operated by the
shooter.</p>

<p>The automatic type of safety consists
of a block, or bar, fitted in the
frame and extending from the safety
bolt to the post of the top lever. When
the top lever is pushed to one side to
open the barrels, this block, or bar,
pushes the safety bolt over the triggers,
automatically blocking them and
preventing accidental discharge. The
triggers must be pressed to withdraw
the automatic safety bar.</p>

<img src="images/illo061a.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">The Rotary Bolt, an American Invention, Is Strongest
Device Known for Locking the Barrels to the Frame</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>To make the shotgun less likely to
go off in the hands of the careless gunner,
the tumbler safety has been incorporated
into the mechanism of a few
American weapons. The tumbler
safety is a bar, automatically operated
by the triggers, and interposed between
the strikers and their firing pins. This
device makes it impossible for the arm
to be discharged by the hammer jarring
off when dropped, for the tumbler bar
occupies its position between the strikers
and firing pins until the triggers
are pulled.</p>

<img src="images/illo061b.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">The Three-Bolt Mechanism Is One Form of the Rotary-Bolting
Principle Used by Many Gun Builders</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The practical value of both the automatic
safety and the tumbler type of
bolt is questioned by practically all experienced
gunners. Its presence is designed
to make the arm less dangerous
in the hands of careless and ignorant
sportsmen. This it may serve to do,
but since there should be no excuse for
tolerating the latter, most handlers of
the scatter gun fail to see the utility of
the former. The novice should lose no
time in acquiring the knack of handling
his chosen weapon, and if he will
but exercise a little care, he will find
the hand-operated safety quite sufficient,
for he will not be troubled
through accidental discharge of his
gun. By far the larger portion of accidents
occur through careless handling
of the gun and by the untimely pulling
of the trigger, either by dragging the
gun through the brush or by nervousness,
and it is impossible to make use
of a safety device to prevent the accidental
discharge.</p>

<h3>The Barrels of a Shotgun</h3>

<p>Between 15 and 20 years ago shotgun
barrels were made by combining
bars of iron and steel and welding them
together to form barrels of the proper
diameter or bore. When these strips
of metal were twisted to make a spiral
tube they were welded together to
make the familiar “twist,” “laminated,”
and “Damascus” barrels. Sometimes
three, four, and five strips of iron and
steel were twisted together to make
the “three-stripe,” “four-stripe,” and
“five-stripe” Damascus barrels. This
old type of a barrel was strong and
flexible, but being comparatively soft,
it was easily damaged by denting.</p>

<div class="container w60emmax">

<img src="images/illo061d.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">The Comparative Sizes of a 20-Gauge and a 12-Gauge
Repeating Shotgun</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The modern compressed-steel barrels
are fashioned from solid drawn
steel, are very hard, will stand much
higher pressure than the Damascus
type, and since the process of manufacture
is simpler, a first-class steel<span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span>
barrel may be produced at one-quarter
the cost of the old type. The several
manufacturers have adopted trade
names to distinguish the various grades
of steel barrels. Various trade names
come from abroad, and those of American
manufacture are labeled “nitro-steel,”
“armor steel,” “high-pressure
steel,” etc. While differences very
likely exist in the quality of the different
barrels sold under the several
names, all the barrels used by reputable
gun builders will be found amply
strong to resist any pressure exerted
by ordinary charges of powder, hence
the cheaper guns are perfectly safe and
will stand many years of hard shooting.</p>

<h3>Locking the Barrels to the Frame</h3>

<p>In the early models of the breech-loader
the barrels were locked to the
frame with a bolt operated by a lever
placed under the fore end. All modern
guns have the top-lever action. In this
device a “lump” is fastened to the
under side of the barrels near the
breech, forming a hinged joint to which
the fore end is attached when fitting
the barrel and stock together. When
closed, the breech end of the barrels is
held down to the action and tight up
against the breech by a slide, or bolt,
which fits into the “lump” attached
underneath the barrels. Different makers
use various forms of top-lever bolting
devices, as the “hook rib” or “extension
rib,” otherwise known as the “doll’s
head,” and the cross bolt first used by
Greener, the celebrated English gun
builder. All of these devices are satisfactory
on a good grade of gun, but
the strongest mechanism is an American
invention, known as the Smith
rotary bolt. This rotary bolt is tapered
and is pushed through an opening in
the rib by means of a strong spring.
Mechanically this locking device is all
that can be desired, and it cannot
loosen through manipulation, because
of its compensating feature, that is,
the spring forces the bolt farther in as
the bearings become worn through
much service. Many of our well-known
builders use this splendid fastening.</p>

<h3>Shotgun Stocks</h3>

<p>Walnut is exclusively used for gunstocks,
and the several grades are
termed plain American walnut, fine
American walnut, English walnut, selected
English walnut, fine English
walnut, Italian walnut, and Circassian
walnut. The plain American walnut is
simply a common quality of black walnut,
oiled and varnished, and fitted on
the cheaper guns. Fine American walnut
is of better quality, darker in color,
and of better grain. It is strong and
durable, and when well oiled and polished
by hand, it makes a neat stock
for the inexpensive gun. The selected
English walnut is of good color and
with good grain. When oiled and
hand-polished it makes an attractive
stock for the knockabout gun. Fine
English walnut is usually fitted to guns
selling at a higher price, and is generally
made to order. Italian walnut
is a dark wood with a fine grain and is
usually supplied to order on the finest
guns. Circassian walnut is the finest
wood obtainable, of a rich dark color
and a fine curly grain. It is therefore
expensive and only finished to order
and fitted to the most expensive guns.</p>

<h3>The Fore End</h3>

<p>The fore end is an extension of the
stock beyond the triggers and frame
and affords a grip for the extended
hand—protecting it from the hot barrel—serves
to lock the barrel to the
frame, and likewise holds the ejector
mechanism. The Deely &amp; Edge, and
Snal fore ends are both used on American
guns, and they are so well designed
and made that it is practically
impossible for the modern types to
loosen even when the arm has been
subjected to long, hard service. Hence
this detail of the shotgun need not be
considered when selecting an arm.</p>

<h3>Self-Ejector Mechanism</h3>

<p>Although a great many shooters do
not use the self-ejector, this handy device
will many times prove of great
value in the field, for when the birds are
coming fast and the shooter happens to
score a miss, the self-ejector throws out<span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span>
the empty shell and enables him to
shove in a fresh load to bring down
the following bird. The nonejecting
arm is plenty good and quick enough
for trap use, for when shooting “clays,”
plenty of time is given each man to
reload between shots, but for upland-bird
and for duck shooting, the automatic
ejector is a desirable addition to
the double-barreled gun.</p>

<h3>Repeating and Automatic Shotguns</h3>

<p>While a good double-barreled gun in
the hands of the average shot will very
likely bag as many birds as the shooter
is entitled to—and it may be depended
on to do this when fitted with a good
automatic ejector—many shooters prefer
the repeating gun. The hand-operated,
sliding fore arm, trombone-action,
or pump gun is so well-known that no
recommendation is needed. It will suffice
to mention that it will do everything
that a double-barreled gun can
perform, and considering that every
pump gun is self-ejecting, and its cost
less than an equal grade of double
gun equipped with an ejecting device,
it is not difficult to understand
its popularity. So far as accuracy is
concerned, the repeater will shoot
rather more steadily than the double-barreled
gun in the hands of the average
man, and after two shots have been
fired, there remain four more in the
magazine. Rapid firing is not always
an advantage, of course, but when after
ducks, the third shot is often wanted in
the interval that is required to load the
double-barreled gun.</p>

<div class="container w50emmax">

<img src="images/illo063a.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">The Shells are Started About One-Quarter Inch in the
Regular Way Before the Ejector Kicks Them Out</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The automatic, or self-loading, shotgun
is the logical development of the
repeater, and while its mechanism is
necessarily more complicated, it has
some merits peculiarly its own. The
devotee of the double barrel is inclined
to believe that the repeater and the automatic
shotgun do not balance so well
as his favorite weapon, and the man
who swears by the pump gun is inclined
to think that the automatic arm
is balanced like a club and prone to
get out of order. Both factions can put
up plenty of argument to support their
opinions, but to the unprejudiced gunner,
both the repeater and the self-loader
will prove very fine guns after
the shooter has become familiar in handling
them. The double-barrel is a
mighty fine gun, so is the repeater and
again the automatic; so let the gunner
pick out the type he likes best.</p>

<h3>How to Select a Shotgun</h3>

<div class="container w50emmax">

<img src="images/illo064b.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">The Measurements are Taken of the Drop at the
Comb and Heel, and of the Stock from the
Butt to the Forward Trigger</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>That the shooter may not be handicapped
by using a misfit gun, it is well
to make a selection at one of the larger
dealers’ where guns of various sizes,
weights and lengths, as well as drops in
stocks, may be tried until one is found
that fits the gunner the best. A good
shot can pick up almost any gun and
do fairly accurate shooting with it, but
he can do better work with a gun fitting
him properly. The chief measurements
of a gunstock are the length and
drop of the stock, and the drop and
shape of the comb. The ordinary
thickness of the grip will suit the average
hand, but in the case of unusually
large or small hands, this must be
taken into consideration. For the average
man these measurements will probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span>
be about right: Length of stock,
from forward trigger to center of butt
plate, A-A, 14 to 14¹⁄₂ in., drop at comb,
B-B, 1¹⁄₂ to 1⁷⁄₈ in., which will give corresponding
drop at the heel, C-C, from
2¹⁄₂ to 3 in. A fairly straight stock of
good length may be reckoned an advantage
for trap shooting, but for use
in the field, a somewhat crooked stock
with more drop at the comb, say, 1⁵⁄₈
in. with 2⁵⁄₈-in. drop at the heel, will
more fully meet the average shooter’s
idea of a well-balanced gun. However,
as men differ, and there are as many
faces and eyes as there are men, every
shooter must decide this question for
himself. So far as the circumference
of the grip is concerned, the size of the
shooter’s hand and the length of his
fingers will decide this detail. For a
small hand, a 7-in. grip is about right,
while a grip of 7¹⁄₂ in. will probably fit
the large hand well. The question of
straight or pistol grip is purely a matter
of personal taste, for one is as good
as the other so far as accurate handling
of the gun is concerned.</p>

<h3>The Gauge, or Size of Bore</h3>

<p>The 10-gauge may be occasionally
useful for long-range duck and goose
shooting, but for ordinary duck and
upland use the 12-gauge is plenty large
enough. The larger the gauge the
greater will be the killing zone, and up
to their ranges the small bores may,
for all practical purposes, be regarded
as shooting quite as accurately and
with as much power as the heavier
gauges, that is, the small bores will
shoot to kill if held correctly. The
standard 12-gauge gun is fitted with
30-in. barrels, weighs 7 to 8 lb., and
the standard load for the field is 3 dr.
of powder and 1¹⁄₈ oz. of shot. This
gives a killing range up to 40 yd. The
standard 16-gauge, with 30-in. barrels,
weighs from 6¹⁄₂ to 7¹⁄₄ lb., and the
standard load is 2¹⁄₂ dr. of powder and
1 oz. of shot, with a killing range up to
35 yd. The standard 20-gauge, with
28-in. barrels, weighs from 5 to 6¹⁄₂ lb.
and the standard load is 2¹⁄₄ dr. of powder
and ⁷⁄₈ oz. of shot. Best killing
range up to 30 yards.</p>

<p>For an all-purpose gun, suitable for
wild fowling as well as upland shooting,
the 12-gauge is the best choice
although the 16-gauge will be found a
hard-hitting weapon. For the good
shot, the 20-gauge will prove a fine
little arm for upland work, only the
gunner must shoot well with the small
bore to kill his bird clean. Contrary
to the notion, the large bore, not the
small gauge, will bring the most game
to the novice’s bag.</p>

between the pins. It is very simple
to make, as it consists of a triangular
piece of wood with ten holes bored
into it at the proper places, the dimensions
of which will be governed by the
size of the pins, and three supports.
The pins are dropped in the holes and
the rack lifted from them.—Contributed

<h2 class="nobreak">Magically Naming a Written Card</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>This experiment consists in requesting
anyone of a company of spectators
to name a card and write it on a piece
of paper, whereupon the performer instantly
names the card written.</p>

<p>Two persons are necessary, the performer
and his assistant. The performer<span class="pagenum" id="Page62">[62]</span>
leaves the room while the spectator
writes the name of the card on
the paper, the assistant supplying the
paper and pencil. When the name of
the card is written, the paper is folded
by the spectator and handed to the
assistant with the pen or pencil. The
assistant lays the pencil and paper on
a table in certain positions to designate
the name of the card. Previous
to this test, the performer and the assistant
must have the positions of the
paper and pencil mentally fixed in their
minds. Referring to the sketch, the four
sides of the table represent the card
suits, viz., spades, hearts, clubs, and
diamonds; and an imaginary circle
divided into twelve parts indicates
the number of the card, 1 standing for
ace, 2 for deuce, and so on.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Dry-Cleaning Mixture</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>An emulsion of gasoline and water
is much used by dry cleaners for removing
grease, tar, and paint spots
from clothing. It is in the form of a
thick, white sirup, which evaporates
entirely and is not injurious to any
fabric or color. The directions for preparing
this emulsion should be followed
out carefully.</p>

<p>Dissolve, in 1 qt. of boiling water,
¹⁄₂ oz. of pure castile soap, and ¹⁄₄ oz.
of gum arabic. Allow this to cool, and
then add 1 oz. glycerin, 1 oz. strong
aqua ammonia, 1¹⁄₂ oz. chloroform, and
2 oz. sulphuric ether. Shake well, and
pour enough of the mixture into a
quart bottle to fill it for ³⁄₄ in. On top
of this, pour not more than ¹⁄₄ in. of
gasoline, and shake until creamy. Repeat
the addition of gasoline, shaking
each time, until full. The cleaning
mixture will then be ready for use, and
may be applied with a rag, or small
brush.</p>

<p>If, on adding the first lot of gasoline
and shaking, the mixture does not become
emulsified, it proves that too
much gasoline has been added. In this
case, allow it to stand for a few minutes,
and pour off the excess gasoline
which comes to the top. Shake well,
and add a smaller quantity of gasoline.
When the bottle is half full, larger
quantities of gasoline may be added at
a time.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the more
gasoline is added, the thicker the emulsion
becomes, and if the addition of
gasoline and shaking is prolonged, a
semisolid jelly is formed, which will
not run from a bottle.—Contributed by

AND HOW TO USE IT<br>
By Stillman Taylor<br>

</div><!--illotext-->

</div><!--container-->

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">H</span><span class="afterlargecap">aving</span> picked out a gun that
“fits the man,” the matter of
choke and pattern should be considered.
For trap shooting and for
wild fowling, the full-choke gun may
be considered a necessity, since it will
throw the charge of shot within a relatively
small circle; in other words,
make a denser pattern. Chokeboring
is accomplished by constricting the
barrel at the muzzle from ¹⁄₂₅ to ¹⁄₅₀
in., the amount of taper depending on
the size of the bore and gauge. The
narrowing of the muzzle forces the
charge of shot together and prevents
the pellets from scattering over a wide
area. Guns are bored with varying degrees
of choke, from the full to the
plain cylinder, and the manufacturers
compare them by recording the number
of pellets which any given choke
will shoot in a 30-in. circle at 30 yd., or
any other range selected as the maximum
distance. This gives the pattern
from which we find that the full choke
produces 70 per cent, the half choke
60 per cent, the quarter choke 50 per
cent, and the cylinder 30 per cent.</p>

<p>For trap shooting and wild fowling
the expert considers it essential that
his 12-gauge should be capable of
throwing not less than 300 pellets;
hence he selects a full-choked gun with
a pattern of 300 or better. As a full-choked
16-gauge will pattern about
275, it may be used for ducks with good
success. For a general-purpose gun, a
pattern from 250 to 275 will prove quite
satisfactory for ducks and upland
game, and this may be had by picking
out a half-choked 12-gauge, or selecting
a full-choked 16-gauge. The 20-gauge
gives a pattern of about 245
shot, and thus scatters its charge over
too large a circle to prove effective on
wild fowl, although it is very effective
on upland game, which is flushed not
over 35 yd. from the shooter. A gun
patterning from 225 to 250 may be considered
the ideal upland gun, and this
may be had by choosing a quarter-choked
12-gauge, a half-choked 16-gauge,
or a full-choked 20-gauge gun.
These are known as “open-choked”
guns, are the most effective at short
ranges, up to 35 yd., and cannot be depended
upon to kill clean when used
at longer ranges.</p>

<h3>Shooting with Both Eyes Open</h3>

<p>To handle the weapon well is the desire
of every sportsman, and this knack
is not difficult to attain, providing the
novice will make a good beginning.
First of all, it is necessary to hold the
gun correctly, and while the forward
hand may grip the fore end at any
convenient point, a well extended arm
gives a better control of the gun when
aiming, by giving free play to all the
muscles of the arm; hence the gun
should be held in a manner natural to
the shooter, rather than in imitation of
the style of another.</p>

<p>The old manner of aiming the shotgun
by closing one eye and sighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page64">[64]</span>
along the rib is fast becoming obsolete,
for better shooting may be done by
keeping both eyes open. Doctor Carter
was the first great exponent of binocular
shooting, and while but few men
can hope to approach this famous gunner’s
skill, every one can learn to
handle a shotgun more quickly and
with greater accuracy by following his
common-sense method. It may appear
a bit strange at first to disregard the
sights and keep both eyes open, and
aim the gun by merely pointing it in
the desired direction, but to sight
along the rib and attempt to see the
bead on the muzzle end can only make
a slow and poky shot. This old-fashioned
method may be good enough for
making patterns on a stationary target,
but it is not much of a success for
wing shooting. For fine rifle shooting
the left eye is invariably closed for
target work, but for snap-shooting
both eyes are kept open, the sights are
disregarded, and the aim is taken by
pointing the gun at the object to be
hit. Of course, there are many good
gunners who shoot with one eye
closed, but the novice who is anxious
to become a good wing shot should
make it a point to practice with both
eyes open. Vision is always clearer,
and the objects more accurately judged
with both eyes open than with one,
and when this is done, and one eye controls
the line of aim, the shooter is not
so likely to make mistakes in estimating
the distances and the rapidity of
the flight of his game. In shooting,
the right eye naturally governs the
right shoulder, and vice versa, and this
is so because habit has trained the eye
to do this. To find which is the master
eye, hold a pencil out at arm’s length
and point it at some small distant object
with both eyes open, then close
the left eye, and if the pencil still
points to the object, the right eye controls
the vision, and is the master eye.
Should the closing of the left eye alter
the aim, the right eye must be trained
by practice until it becomes the master
eye, or else the gun must be shot from
the left shoulder, which is many times
more difficult. The modern way of
mastering wing shooting is to point
the gun where both eyes are looking,
and after a little practice this may be
done quickly, and the charge thrown
more accurately at the object than by
closing one eye, or sighting along the
barrel in the old manner.</p>

<h3>The Knack of Hitting a Flying Target</h3>

<p>When shooting at clay targets, or
at a flying bird, allowance must be
made for the swiftness of flight and
the distance from the shooter to the
game, or in other words, the shooter
must calculate the speed of the flying
target and allow the probable time it
will take for the shot to reach its mark.
To make a quick snap shot at the flying
target, the gun may be directly
thrown at the mark and discharged as
quickly as possible, or the gun may
cover the mark and be quickly swung
ahead and the charge sent at the point
where the swiftly moving bird will be
found when the shot gets there. Snap-shooting
is only possible when the
birds are flying straight away or quartering,
and as the shooter fires point-blank
at the rapidly moving bird, the
shot must be delivered so rapidly that
only a very quick and responsive
trigger and a fast man back of it can
hope to score even a fair percentage
of hits. A more certain way of aiming
a snap shot is to throw up the
barrel below the bird, then rapidly
swing it to the proper elevation ahead
of the moving target, and throw the
shot at the point where the line of the
aim and the flight of the bird intersect.
For shots at quail, woodcock, and partridge
in the brush, the quick snap shot
often must be taken, regardless of the
chances of missing, for to delay even
a second will lose the bird. When a
bird rises near the shooter, no allowance
of lead or elevation are required,
and the charge is thrown directly at
the bird.</p>

<p>The rapid swing, however, is the
most accurate manner of using the
shotgun, at all angles and at any distance
within the killing zone of the
weapon. To make this shot, the gun
must be thrown up behind the bird and<span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span>
then rapidly swung ahead of it, throwing
the charge without checking the
swing of the arm. In this style of snap-shooting,
the elevation of the gun must
be identical with the flight of the bird,
inasmuch as the gun follows it, and if
the gun is swung about three
times as fast as the bird is
traveling, plenty of allowance
for the time necessary to press
the trigger and deliver the shot
at the determined point will be made.</p>

<p>To swing deliberately and
cover the bird with the sight,
then shove the gun ahead to
give the proper lead, is all right
for duck shooting where the
game is usually seen approaching
and thus remains within
range for a longer time. But
this deliberate style of handling
the gun is far too slow for the
uplands, and since the rapid swing is
the only accurate manner of cutting
down the fast bird, and usually useful
for wild fowling, the novice should
confine his practice to this practical
style of wing shooting.</p>

<h3>Stationary-Target Practice</h3>

<p>The first great mistake the novice is
likely to make is the natural one of
supposing that he must take his gun
to the field and learn how to handle it
by practicing at flying game. This is
by no means the best method, and there
is scarcely a poorer way of becoming
a wing shot, because the gunner is intent
upon bagging the game and forgets
to observe the many little points
of gunnery, shooting high and low, and
making the hundred and one mistakes
of judgment he would not be guilty
of when practicing at a stationary
mark. Snap and wing shooting is the
last word in shotgun handling, requiring
quickness in throwing the gun, as
well as a trained eye to calculate the
distance from and the speed of the flying
target. To acquire confidence in
using the gun, begin by shooting at a
fixed mark. A good target may be
made by obtaining a dozen, or two,
sheets of stout wrapping paper and
painting a 4-in. circle in the center of
each sheet. Tack it up on a board fence
or on a board hung on a tree, measure
off 60 ft., and
try a shot. The
shot will not
spread very much at this short range,
and it will be an easy matter to determine
the result of your skill in
holding a dead-on to the large mark.
To avoid flinching and other movements
of the head and body, caused by
the recoil, begin your first practicing
with a light powder-and-shot charge,
say, about 2 dr. of bulk measure, or
its equivalent in smokeless, and ⁷⁄₈ oz.
of No. 8 or 9 shot. There is no advantage
in using a heavier charge, and
the recoil of the gun will appear much
greater in deliberate shooting at a target
than is likely to be felt during
the excitement incidental to shooting
in the field. A dozen shots at these
targets will enable the gunner to make
a good score by deliberate holding,
and when this can be done without
flinching, snap and wing shooting may
begin.</p>

<div class="container w50emmax">

<p class="caption">The Forward Hand may Grip the
Fore End at Any Point, but a
Well-Extended Arm Gives a
Better Control of the Gun</p>

</div><!--container-->

<h3>Snap and Wing Shooting</h3>

<p>The object which the gunner should
now strive for is to train the eye, hand,
and gun to work in unison, and to do
this, bring the gun quickly to the
shoulder, point it to the mark, and
press the trigger without stopping the
upward and even swing of the barrels.
At the first few trials some difficulty
may be encountered with the pressing<span class="pagenum" id="Page66">[66]</span>
of the trigger at the proper moment,
but a little practice will soon tell how
to time the shots. Note the phrase,
“press the trigger,”
for the trigger
is not pulled
by the forefinger
alone, but rather
pressed by closing
both hands, the
forward hand on the
fore end pushing and
closing, and the hand
grasping the stock being drawn back
and squeezed at the same instant. This
is easily done, but rather hard to picture.
After a few trials with an empty
gun, the novice will see the point, and
also discover the fact that the recoil of
the arm is much lessened by this
proper grip of the weapon.</p>

<p>Confine the first practice in snap-shooting
to throwing the gun to the
shoulder, and when proficient in hitting
the mark, try a snap shot by
swinging the gun from the side, right
to left and also left to right. Do not
attempt to check the even swing of
the gun, but rather let the barrels
swing past the mark, concentrating the
mind upon pressing the trigger the instant
the line of aim covers the mark.
Practice swinging slowly, and after
being able to hit the mark with the
center of the charge pretty regularly,
increase the speed of the swing. In
doing this, it will be discovered that
the speed of pressing the trigger must
also be increased to balance the speed
of the moving barrel, and very likely
it will be found that the natural tendency
is to press the trigger a bit late.
This is the common mistake which
practically every novice makes when
in the field, although the error is likely
to pass unnoticed when after game.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>As the gunner
acquires proficiency
in swinging
the gun from side
to side, try swinging
the gun at different
angles,
changing the angle
of the swing with
each shot, from
right to left and upward,
at an oblique
angle upward, and so on, until it is
possible to hit the mark with a fair
certainty from a variety of angles.
When trying out the several swings,
one should always begin slowly and
increase the speed of the swing as
he becomes more expert, only making
sure to shoot by calculation and not
by guess. The manner of acquiring
expertness sounds easy and is comparatively
easy, and, as it is the backbone
of snap-shooting, improvement
will be rapid if the novice is willing
to practice slowly and master each detail
in turn. Do not make the mistake
of overdoing the thing at the outset
by shooting too long at a time. A
box of 25 loads is ample for a day’s
practice, since it is not how much one
shoots, but how well, that counts.</p>

<h3>Snap-Shooting at Moving Targets</h3>

<p>When the gunner has reached the
point where he can hit the stationary
target by swinging his gun both fast
and slow, he has acquired better control
of the weapon than many old
shooters, and he is well prepared to
take up snap-shooting at flying or moving
targets. The access to a gun club<span class="pagenum" id="Page67">[67]</span>
where clay birds may be shot at, will
prove of much value, but this is not
absolutely necessary, since tin cans,
bits of brick, and bottles, thrown in
the air at unknown angles by a companion,
will afford the needed variety.
Better than this is one of the inexpensive
“hand traps” which project the
regulation clay targets by means of
a powerful spring worked by a trigger.
One of the large powder manufacturers
makes a trap of this kind, and a very
good trap can be had for $1.50. The
standard clay targets cost about $2.50
a barrel of 500. Practice of this sort
may be made a very interesting and
highly instructive sport, providing the
targets are projected from different
and unexpected angles, thus simulating
the many-angled flight of the live
bird.</p>

<h3>Value of Second Barrel in Shooting</h3>

<p>The use of the second barrel should
not be overlooked in practicing with
the idea of becoming an all-around
wing shot, for the second shot is often
needed to kill a cripple, or bring down
a bird which has been missed with the
first shot. Two-shot practice should
begin by placing two paper targets
about 20 ft. apart, then shooting at
the first one and continuing to swing
the gun to cover the second target.
Practice swinging from various angles
as directed for the initial practice, increasing
the speed of the swing as
proficiency is gained, and fail not to
profit by the mistakes which must inevitably
occur to all who try to master
the shotgun. After a reasonable
amount of practice, conducted along
these lines, the gunner may venture
afield, and if his acquaintance includes
an old seasoned sportsman who will
point out the mistakes made, much
may be learned regarding the knack of
handling the gun, as well as relating
to the haunts and habits of our wild
game birds.</p>

<h3>Cleaning and Care of the Gun</h3>

<p>A good shotgun is a thoroughly reliable
and dependable weapon, but as
with all tools of the sportsman’s craft,
the best results can only be had when
the arm is in good condition. It is
gun wisdom always to clean the
weapon after a day’s shooting, and the
amateur should make it a positive rule
never to put his gun away until it is
cleaned. The sooner firearms are
cleaned after the firing the better, and
if cleaned before the burnt powder has
had time to corrode the steel, much
future trouble is saved. In cleaning
the barrels, never rest the muzzle
against the floor. If a rest is needed,
use an old piece of carpet or a bundle of
rags. Clean from the breech end only,
as any slight dust, or burr, at the muzzle
will greatly impair the shooting
qualities of any firearm. Never use a
wire-wheel scratchbrush, as it will
scratch the polished steel; a soft brass-wire
cleaner is the only suitable implement
for this work. There are several
good cleaners to be had. For removing
any rust deposits, a brass brush may be
used, while for ordinary cleaning,
plenty of cloth should be run through
the barrels, taking care that it touches
every part of the interior. This is
easily done by rotating the cleaning
rod as it is pushed through the barrel
from the breech to the muzzle. When
putting the gun away, the barrels
should be stopped, at the breech and
muzzle, with tightly fitting corks, or
gun ropes may be run through the
barrels after soaking them in some
good oil. To prevent rusting, cover
the metal, outside as well as inside the
barrels, by smearing on a little heavy
lubricating oil. Slip covers of chamois
are often used to protect the stock and
barrels before putting them in the
leather case, but stout woolen covers
are better, since chamois is likely to
absorb more or less moisture.</p>

<p>The mechanism of a gun is not
exactly complicated, but the novice had
better leave well enough alone and not
attempt to dismount the locks or tinker
with the mechanism. The modern
steel barrel is very hard and not easily
dented, but if so injured, it is better
to ship it to the factory for repairs
than to trust it to the crude methods
of the average gun repairman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page68">[68]</span></p>

<p>A gun should be given ordinary
good care, and this is not forthcoming
if one makes a practice of opening it
and letting the barrels drop down with
a bang. Snapping the triggers on an
empty barrel is likewise foolish. If
one desires to practice trigger pressing,
put a couple of empty shells in the
barrels.</p>

<p>If one owns a good-grade shotgun,
the stock is probably finished in oil and
hand-rubbed to a nice, durable polish.
On cheap arms the varnish is usually
employed to give an attractive finish
in the store. Of course, this varnish
will scratch, and otherwise come off,
and spoil the appearance of the arm.
If a good finish is wanted, do not re-varnish
the stock, but remove all the
old varnish by using a little varnish remover,
and rub down with oil. For an
extra-fine polish, wet the wood to
raise the grain; rub down with very
fine sandpaper; wet the wood again,
and sandpaper a second or a third
time; then rub down with oil until the
wood is saturated with it, and polish
with a cloth, using plenty of pressure,
and the stock will be as fine in appearance
as if it had the “London oil
finish” supplied with all high-grade
guns.</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>The fire screen <a href="#Fig69a">illustrated</a> can be
constructed at very small expense. In
brief, the screen consists of a light
metal frame surrounding three pieces
of ¹⁄₈-in. sheet asbestos. The frames inclosing
the asbestos pieces are hinged
together, as shown in Fig. 1, with special
hinges made to meet the requirements.</p>

<p>The asbestos comes in sheets 40 in.
square, and this size determines the
outside dimensions of the screen. The
size of the different sections can, of
course, be changed if such a change
will better suit the existing needs. By
making the screen in sections it may
be folded up and thus occupy much
less space, and when in use, the sections,
by placing them at an angle to
each other, serve the purpose of legs,
which would be required if the screen
were in one straight piece.</p>

<p>The dimensions and form of the
outer portions of the frame are given
in Fig. 2, and those of the inner portions,
or edges, where the hinges are
attached, are given in Fig. 3. The
joining edges of the frames are made
wider than the others for the reason
that some of the metal is cut away
where the hinges are attached. These
frames may be made from heavy tin
or galvanized iron, and it will be a simple
matter for a tinner to bend them
into shape. After all these pieces are<span class="pagenum" id="Page69">[69]</span>
bent, fit them together at the corners,
making sure that they clamp tightly
on the asbestos sheets, as these help
to hold the frame in shape. Drill a
small hole in each of the corners and
provide a small round-head rivet of
proper length for each of the holes.
The vertical portions of the frame
should be placed inside of the horizontal,
or end, pieces at the corners.</p>

the holes in the ends of them and solder
the ends of the rods to the inside
of the frames. Make sure that there
is no solder run in between the rod
and piece of brass, as this will prevent
the hinge from operating freely. After
the hinges are in place, the frames are
riveted together. Notches are cut in
the edges of the asbestos sheets at the
location of the hinges to allow the latter
free movement. The sections of the
screen may be made very rigid by placing
a number of small rivets around the
inner edges of the frame to hold it
tightly against the asbestos. The asbestos
may be given a coat of bronze,
or be otherwise decorated for appearance.</p>

<p>A very interesting experiment may
be made with the ordinary dollar

A pendulum 39.1
in. long will
make 60 one-way
swings per minute,
the number
of swings varying
inversely as
the square root
of the length.
By actual count
it was found that the balance wheel of
the watch in question made 240 one-way

4 times as fast as the 39-in. pendulum.
Therefore, according to the foregoing
law, a pendulum ¹⁄₁₆ as long, or about
2¹⁄₂ in., would swing in unison with
the wheel of the watch. The question
then arises as to what would happen
if the watch itself were suspended so as
to swing as a pendulum of the latter

watch keeps on swinging continuously.
The swing amounts to about ³⁄₈ in.,

Game Fish<br>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">T</span><span class="afterlargecap">here</span> are many enjoyable phases
of the fisher’s art, but bait casting
from the free reel probably has a
wider appeal than any other branch of
angling. The pleasure of handling a
short bait-casting rod is in itself a good
sport, even when casting done in the
back yard is made for distance and accuracy
only. Get two or three enthusiastic
casters together, and you may
have an interesting little tournament,
held on a vacant lot, on the lake, or on
the greensward of a city park. There
is plenty of action in casting from the
reel, and it is its variety that has made
angling of this type so universally popular.
True, considerable practice is required
before the caster is able to shoot
an accurate plug far off, but the knack
may be gained after reasonable application.
The handling of the short rod
differs from all other angling methods—it
is an active sport rather than a
contemplative recreation—and when
the fun of handling a good outfit is
combined with the sport of coaxing out
a black bass, shooting a wooden minnow
among the lily pads for pickerel,
or casting the bait for those pirates of
our fresh-water lakes, the wall-eyed
pike and the muskellunge, the angler
gets a taste of fishing—plus.</p>

<h3>The Outfit and Its Selection</h3>

<p>A good firearm is necessary to the
good marksman and a well-made,
nicely balanced rod, to which is
clamped a smooth-running reel, is the
essential equipment of an able angler.
Bait casting is, of course, more a matter
of skill than of outfit, but that is no
reason why the angler should be handicapped
by poor tackle, although large
expenditure is not necessary in obtaining
a satisfactory outfit. The casting
rod may be from 5 to 6 ft. long. Where
the caster regards length of cast as the
important factor, the 5-ft. length will
probably give the best satisfaction.
However, the superiority of one over
the other in this regard is rather to be
found in the elasticity and quality of
the rod than its length. The skill of
the caster is, moreover, the ruling factor.
The 5¹⁄₂-ft. rod is better than the
5-ft. length for fishing purposes, and
the 6-ft. rod is more resilient than the
5¹⁄₂-ft. tip. If the greatest range is not
of more importance than the landing
of the fish, the longer rod will prove
the most pleasant to handle.</p>

<p>The split-bamboo rod has many
friends, and a well-made rod of this
material is a thoroughly satisfactory
casting tool. A fine-quality casting rod
of split bamboo costs from $10 to $25.
A fairly good rod may be bought for
$2 or a trifle less, and a smooth-running
reel for another $2, while a line for it
will bring the total up to about $5. An
outfit of this kind purchased with discrimination,
while not embodying everything
that a critical angler would
desire, will cast a long and accurate
line and stand up under the strain of
handling our heaviest game fish. The
one-piece rod is classed by many anglers
as the ideal casting rod. The
two-piece rod is handier to pack and is
more generally used.</p>

<p>The chief fault in bait-casting rods
is the stiff action of the tip section.
For tournament casting, a fairly stiff
rod is desirable. The same requirement<span class="pagenum" id="Page72">[72]</span>
holds good for muskellunge and other
heavy fishing. A flexible rod affords
more pleasure in playing black bass and
other active “gamey” fish. However,
the best way to test out a rod is by
casting with it.</p>

<div class="container" id="Fig72">

<img src="images/illo076.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">A Serviceable Reel Costing $4, a High-Grade Reel Costing $13.50, and a Fine Tournament Casting Reel Costing

</div><!--container-->

<p>The steel casting rod is well liked by
some casters, but only a high-quality
steel rod is worthy of consideration. It
is generally not classed as the equal of
a well-made solid-wood or split-bamboo
rod, for casting. The better-grade
steel rod is springy and flexible, and
for this reason is a good rod for casting
for black bass. Still, most anglers have
a steel rod in their outfits, but it is not
as generally used at tournaments as
the time-tried wooden rod.</p>

<p>The guide is an important detail of
a casting rod. Inexpensive rods are
usually provided with large metal
guides, while the better rods are fitted
with agate guides, or with agate tip
and hand guides. A guide, ¹⁄₂ in. in
diameter, at the butt of the rod is large
enough and will handle the line
smoothly.</p>

<p>The single grip is sometimes preferred
by casters, but the additional
grip placed above the reel is desirable
if much fishing is done. Solid-cork hand
grasps are most satisfactory, being less
slippery when wet and less tiring to
the hand than handles made of other
materials. If the lower grip is properly
shaped with a forward edge, the
forefinger will find a firm grip upon it,
and the finger hook will not be needed.
However, some anglers prefer to use
the hook, and if the rod is not so fitted,
a detachable hook may be fastened to
it. A reel band that locks securely is
desirable, and all the better grades of
casting rods are so fitted.</p>

<p>The quadruple reel is the logical
choice of the bait caster, the spool turning
four times to one turn of the handle.
As the work demanded of a bait-casting
reel is different and more
exacting than that of the click reel used
in fly casting, its design is radically different.
The best type of click reel is
of large spool diameter and narrow between
plates, while the typical casting
reel is its direct opposite—being long-barreled,
with plates of comparatively
small diameter. For tournament casting
the finest outfit will naturally be
selected, but for practical work it is
unnecessary to pay $25 for a finely
wrought reel. Three typical reels are
shown in the <a href="#Fig72">illustration</a>. The one at
the left holds 80 yd. of line, can be
easily taken apart for cleaning, and
costs $4. In the center is a level-winding
reel with thumb click and adjustable
drag placed on the rims of the
plates. It holds 60 yd. of line, and costs
$13.50. At the right is a very high-grade
reel for tournament casting. It
has a cork arbor, jeweled bearings
holds 60 yd. of line, and costs $26.</p>

<p>Any of the better grades of braided
silk are suitable for the bait-casting
line. The average price for a dependable
line is about $1 for 50 yd. A small
size line is best, and sizes G and E are
preferred. A brown and green, or other
dark-colored, line is preferable for fishing.
The black and white, all white
and other light-colored, lines are satisfactory
for tournament use. After a
day’s fishing the line should be unreeled
and looped around the back of a
chair in loose coils to dry, or loosely
wound upon a drying reel.</p>

<p>For practice and tournament casting
one of the standard ¹⁄₄ and ¹⁄₂-oz. loaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page73">[73]</span>
wooden or metal plugs may be used.
The popularity of bait casting from the
reel has brought forth a large variety
of artificial baits. These wooden and
enameled lures are used by anglers because
they bring the catches.</p>

<p>The wooden minnows, and other
forms of artificial bait, may be roughly
classed in three divisions: the surface
lures for use on top of the water; the
diving and under-water baits; and the
weedless varieties, which are usually of
the surface type. No bait caster’s outfit
is complete unless it includes one
bait of each class, and to meet fully
the different and varying conditions of
weather, season, and water, it is a good
plan to select one of each type in light
and medium-dark colors. A variety of
typical baits are shown in the <a href="#Fig74">page
plate</a> at A, B, C, etc. Many of the baits
are provided with one or more eyes for
attaching the line, thus enabling the
caster to spin his bait at different
depths. All of the wooden-body baits
will float, and only dive under the surface
when reeled in; the quicker they
are retrieved the deeper they spin.
While many of these baits have been
designed especially to entice the black
bass, practically all of them are good
for pickerel and general fresh-water
casting, particularly the minnow baits.</p>

<p>The other items which complete the
bait caster’s outfit are the landing net
and tackle box. The net should be well
made, with a steel hoop 13 in. or larger
in diameter, and should have a handle
about 3 ft. long. The folding type of
net is the most convenient, and is provided
with a separate handle. The
tackle box may be of sheet metal or
leather, with partitions for holding
reels, baits, and the angling “what
not.” A convenient and serviceable
landing net costs $1 or more, and a
tackle box will cost about as much.</p>

<h3>Suggestions on Making the Cast</h3>

<p>Although much practice is required
before the caster can take his place in
a tournament, “getting the hang” of
handling the short rod and free-running
reel comes quickly. As soon as
the simple principles are understood,
length and accuracy will come only
through practice. Bait casting is easier
than fly casting and the angler need
concern himself only with the length
and accuracy of his cast, since delicacy
does not enter into this phase of fishing.
The coarser sweet-water fish, like
black bass and pickerel, are not frightened
when the bait hits the water with
a splash—indeed, the splash of the bait
attracts them.</p>

<p>Two methods of casts are used by
bait casters, the overhead and the underhand
or side cast. The overhead
cast is used largely by the practical
angler, as well as by those who take
part in tournament contests, because
the bait is projected a longer distance
and may be more accurately placed.
If the novice will thumb the line, as
shown in <a href="#Fig74">Fig. 1</a>, with thumb bearing
directly on the cross rod of the reel
with the ball of the thumb resting
lightly on the line, one or two trials
will show the correct manner of spooling.
The line is retrieved as shown in
<a href="#Fig74">Fig. 2</a>, care being taken to form correct
habits from the start. To make the
cast, reel in the bait until it is some 6 in.
from the tip, release the click or drag,
and press the ball of the thumb firmly
upon the spooled line. Carry the rod
over the shoulder until it is horizontal
or nearly so, as in <a href="#Fig74">Fig. 3</a>, and then
bring it smartly forward, checking it
quickly when it reaches an angle
of some 45°, as shown in <a href="#Fig74">Fig. 4</a>. This
projects the bait forward in a straight
line. When the rod is brought forward
the tension of the thumb on the spool
is released so that the spool will revolve
freely, but enough pressure must
be communicated by the thumb to prevent
the reel from spinning faster than
the line is unreeled from the spool,
otherwise backlash will occur. The use
of the whole arm and the weight of the
body, combined with the elasticity of
the pliant rod, enables the caster to
cover a surprisingly long distance after
a little practice. A distance of 150 ft.
is not difficult to attain, but for fishing,
a well-placed cast of 60 or 75 ft. is
long enough to reach promising
stretches of water.</p>

<p>The underhand or side cast is somewhat
easier to master, and is made
much in the same way as the overhead
cast, only the rod is swung horizontally
to the rear, the tip on a level with the
angler’s chest, as shown in <a href="#Fig74">Fig. 5</a>.
Bring the rod forward smartly in the
direction it is desired to shoot the bait,
check the rod when about horizontal,
partly releasing the pressure of the
thumb, just enough to allow the spool
to revolve freely, and check the line as
the bait hits the water. <a href="#Fig74">Figure 5</a> shows
the beginning of the side cast and <a href="#Fig74">Fig.
6</a> the cast completed. This cast is useful
when fishing from a shore overhung
with trees, and with practice the bait
may be projected a long distance.</p>

<p>The chief factor of skill in bait casting
from the reel lies in controlling the
line, and the thumb must be trained to
do this through practice. Some casters
turn the reel sideways with the handle
downward while making the cast, but
the majority keep the reel level and
cast with it in the same position as
when reeling in. Thumbing the line is
easiest done when the spool is well
filled, and if the casting line is not long
enough to do this, sufficient common
line should be first wound on to fill it.</p>

<p>The successful bait caster is one who
possesses an intimate knowledge of the
fish he casts for, and while a lengthy
exposition is not to form a part of this
article, reference to the fish commonly
sought by the caster will not be amiss.
The fish generally of interest to the
bait caster are small and large-mouth
black bass, pike, muskellunge, and
pickerel. The small-mouth black bass
is classed as the finest game fish, ounce
for ounce, by many casters. The muskellunge,
often confused with the Great
Lakes or English pike, is more limited
in range than the pike, being found in
the Great Lakes region and the waters
of the St. Lawrence River.</p>

<p>Since the habits and general characteristics
of the large-mouth bass are
much the same as its near relative, the
small-mouth, the following hints apply
to both. When wading, it is well to
cast downstream. Cast in the shallows,
near the weeds and snags, and close to
stumps. As little noise should be made
as possible.</p>

<p>For early-spring casting, bass are
likely to be found in the shallows and
sheltered places during the day, because
the water is cool at this season.
The pickerel will also be found in the
warmer and shallower waters. The most
successful baits at this time are the diving
minnows, and other under-water
lures. As the warmer days of late
spring and early summer appear, the
bass swim out into deeper and cooler
water, while the pickerel remain close
to the lily pads. The wooden minnows
are excellent baits to use at this season.
When the weeds are very thick, one of
the several kinds of weedless baits may
be used.</p>

<p>The early-morning and late-afternoon
hours are the best for midsummer
casting, and the shallow places are the
good spots to work over. If there are
any brooks or streams emptying into
the lake or pond, do not neglect to
work this stretch well at the mouth.
When the sun is low, the white or
light-colored surface baits may be substituted
for the medium-dark colored
diving varieties, and for casting after
dark, a luminous or moonlight bait will
often give good results. During the
fall months fishing conditions are similar
to casting in the spring, but the
deep water is then the warmest, and
the under-water or diving baits are
usually the best.</p>

<p>To catch bass, the angler must cast
his bait where the fish are feeding, and
he will find it an advantage to match
natural conditions, so far as possible,
in selecting his baits. For casting on
bright days in clear waters, the red,
white and red, white, or green minnows
are good lures, as are also the
silverplated spoon baits. Cast well
ahead of the boat, and reel in very
slowly to keep the plug spinning well
below the surface. On cloudy days
and in muddy waters, after a heavy
rain, for example, use red and yellow
baits and goldplated or burnished-copper
spoons. The best all-around bait—equally
good for bass and pickerel—is
one of the green-backed minnows,<span class="pagenum" id="Page76">[76]</span>
but no one bait can be expected to
meet all conditions, hence the caster
should have a fair assortment of baits.</p>

<p>A stiff casting rod with plenty of
backbone is essential for muskellunge.
The angler is out after big game and
must be prepared for the sport. A
hard, braided silk line, size E, and 3-0
or 4-0 hooks, snelled and swiveled, are
the best. Any of the wooden baits
suitable for pickerel—the minnows especially—are
good for muskellunge. A
man to handle the oars is a handy companion,
and after casting the bait just
outside the weed bed, make for deep
water as soon as a fish is hooked. The
fish will be seen and felt quickly
enough, and when it breaks water
and leaps in the air, give it a little slack
line quickly, otherwise the strain will
snap the leader. A twisted, bronzed
trace is the best to use between line
and bait, and this need not be longer
than a foot—6 in. is enough. When
the fish is brought alongside, shoot him
through the head with a revolver
which is probably the most satisfactory
manner of making an easy landing.</p>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">C</span><span class="afterlargecap">anoe</span> making is commonly considered
more difficult than building
the larger and heavier craft but
many amateurs with only ordinary experience
and tools have turned out
satisfactory canoes, and if the simple
directions given here are carefully followed
out, the work will proceed rapidly
and no difficulty will be encountered.
Working with light materials,
the canoe builder must pay particular
attention to the workmanship, and, as
it is many times more difficult to patch
up mistakes in a canoe than it is in
rowboats or other heavier craft, the
work must not be hurried, but plenty
of time taken to do each and every part
well and in a workmanlike manner.</p>

<p>The craft described, which is the
regulation open or Canadian model, is
comparatively light and draws very
little water. It is not a flimsy makeshift,
but a stiff and thoroughly dependable
canoe designed for long service,
which, barring accidents and given
reasonably good care, will continue to
give satisfaction for many years. The
tools needed are the common ones
found in most homes, consisting of a
rip and cross-cut saw, chisel, screwdriver,
drawknife, awl, brace and bits,
rule, hammer, vise, plane, and three or
four cheap wood, or metal, screw
clamps. The list of material given is
for a canoe having a length of about
16 ft., 31-in. beam, 18-in. depth at the
ends, 12¹⁄₂-in. depth amidships, and
weighing from 60 to 70 lb., according
to the material.</p>

<p>While oak or ash makes the best
stems, other woods may be used, rock
elm and fir being very satisfactory substitutes.
Where cedar is specified,
spruce pine, cypress, or fir may likewise
be employed. The materials for
molds and ribbands, which are required
to give form to the craft, may be cut
from any cheap stuff, and this will
reduce the cost somewhat.</p>

<h3>The Backbone and Molds</h3>

<p>The first step in the construction of
a canoe is to get out the backbone and
the molds, or forms, which give the correct
dimensions and shape of the craft.
The backbone may be made from any
inexpensive soft wood, such as cedar,
spruce, pine, or cypress; and for making
it a piece of lumber, 16 ft. long, 4
in. wide, and ⁷⁄₈ in. thick, is used. By
referring to <a href="#Fig78">Fig. 1</a> it will be seen that
the upper edge measures exactly 15
ft. 8³⁄₄ in., and that the lower edge is
¹⁄₂ in. longer, giving a total length of
15 ft. 9¹⁄₄ in. The spaces numbered
from each end of the backbone toward
the center, as 1, 2, 3, and 4, indicate
where the corresponding molds are to
be placed. Seven molds are used and
as a canoe is tapered alike at both ends
the molds are numbered alike and are
made exactly to the same dimensions.</p>

<div class="container" id="Fig78">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 1</span><br>
The First Step in the Construction of a Canoe Is to Get Out the Backbone and the Molds, or Forms, Which
Give the Correct Dimensions and Shapes of the Craft</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>A good way to lay out the backbone
accurately is first to mark the total
length, making the lower edge 1 in.
longer than represented in <a href="#Fig78">Fig. 1</a>, then
measure along the top edge exactly
22¹⁄₄ in., and run a pencil line across.
From this line measure off ³⁄₄ in. and
draw a second line across the width of
the board parallel with the first. This
space represents the thickness of the
mold, and it is marked 1. Measure off
23¹⁄₄ in. and make two parallel lines
as before and number it 2, measure
another 23¹⁄₄-in. length and number it
3. Begin measuring from the opposite
end of the board as in the first instance,
22¹⁄₄ in. and give it number 1, then
mark off 2 and 3 the same as for the
end already marked. The board is
then cut off at the bevel mark at each
end.</p>

<h3>The Molds or Forms</h3>

<p>The molds which give the form to
the hull are shown and numbered in
the order that they are fastened to the
backbone. To get out No. 1 mold draw
a rectangle on a sheet of stiff paper
exactly 13⁵⁄₈ in. long and 11 in. wide as
shown in <a href="#Fig79a">Fig. 2</a>. Run cross lines to
divide it in quarters and mark out the
center mortise for the backbone, which
is 5 in. deep and ⁷⁄₈ in. wide. Measure
4 in. toward each side from the outside
edge of the backbone mortise and
mark the mortises for receiving the
gunwales, which are 1⁵⁄₈ in. long and
³⁄₄ in. wide or deep. To obtain the correct
bilge curve lay the rule on the
bottom line and measure off exactly
1 in. to the left of the center dividing
line and make dot 0. Measure 2³⁄₄ in.
farther to the left, to A; turn the rule
at right angles and measure 2¹⁄₈ in. inside
the line and make dot 1. Measure
1¹⁄₂ in. to the left of A, turn rule at
right angles and measure up the sheet
exactly 4⁷⁄₈ in. and make dot 2, which
will be ¹⁄₄ in. inside of the left vertical
line. On the center horizontal line,
which is 1¹⁵⁄₁₆ in. above dot 2, mark dot
3, ¹⁄₁₆ in. from the left vertical line.
Measure off 2 in. above the horizontal
center line and make dot 4 on the vertical
line. The space between these
two dots is the widest part of the bilge
curve. Lay the rule on the bottom line
of the gunwale mortise and measure
off ³⁄₁₆ in. from the outside line and
make dot 5. Pencil the angle from dot
to dot and draw in the full curve. Cut
out the half section, fold on the vertical
center line, and draw the right side.</p>

<div class="container w25emmax" id="Fig79a">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 2</span></p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Two complete No. 2 molds are required,
but it is more convenient to
make each mold in two sections. Each
half is made 11¹⁄₂ in. wide and 12 in.
deep, as shown in <a href="#Fig79b">Fig. 3</a>. First draw
a rectangle to these dimensions and<span class="pagenum" id="Page79">[79]</span>
run cross lines to divide it into quarters.
Beginning at the upper right-hand
corner, mark the mortises for
gunwales and backbone, which, being
only one-half of the complete form,
will be ⁷⁄₁₆ in. wide and 3¹⁄₄ in. deep.
Laying the rule on the outside line immediately
below the mortise, draw a
second mortise for the keel, which is
³⁄₈ in. deep and 1¹⁄₂ in. wide in the half
section. Measure off 1³⁄₄ in. to the left
along the bottom line from keel mortise
and make dot 1. The dot 2 is made
by measuring 2¹⁄₂ in. to the left of 1,
turning the rule at right angles at B
and measuring ⁵⁄₁₆ in. inside the line as
shown in the sketch. Make the dot 3
at a point 1³⁄₄ in. to the left of 2 and ³⁄₄
in. inside of the line. The dot 4 is 1³⁄₄
in. from C and 1³⁄₄ in. inside of the line.
The dot 5 is 1¹⁄₄ in. farther to the left
and 3¹⁄₄ in. inside of the line. The dot
6 is ⁵⁄₈ in. from dot 5 and 4³⁄₄ in. inside
of the line, which will bring it ³⁄₈ in.
inside of the left
vertical line. At
a point 1¹⁄₂ in.
above 6 make
dot 7 on the marginal
line, and
dot 8, 1¹⁄₄ in.
above it. Between
the dots 7
and 8 is the widest
part of the
bilge curve. Dot
9 in exactly ¹⁄₄
in. inside of the
vertical marginal line. These dots produce
the angles, and it is only necessary
to trace in the full curve and cut
it out to make a pattern for the other
three half sections needed.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 3</span><br>
It Is More Convenient to Make Each Mold in Two
Sections, as Two Complete Molds are Required</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The molds No. 3, <a href="#Fig79c">Fig. 4</a>, are located
near the center of the canoe and are
made a trifle wider. Make a rectangle
14³⁄₈ in. long by 12 in. wide and draw
cross line dividing it into quarters.
Trace the half mortises for the backbone,
gunwale, and keel from the No.
2 mold pattern. Lay the rule on the
bottom line and measure off ¹⁄₂ in. to
the left from the center vertical line
and mark dot 1, which is the beginning
of the bilge curve. At a point 2³⁄₄ in.
to the left and ³⁄₄ in. inside of the line
place dot 2, and 2 in. to the left of this
and 2¹⁄₄ in. inside of the line place dot
3, then 1¹⁄₈ in. farther to the left turn
the rule at right angles and measure
up 4 in. inside of the line for dot 4,
which is ¹³⁄₁₆ in. inside of the left marginal
line. At a point 2 in. above dot
4 make dot 5 on the marginal line and
2¹⁄₈ in. above it make dot 6. The space
between gives the widest part of the
bilge curve, with dot 7 exactly ¹⁄₄ in.
inside of the marginal line, measuring
along the bottom of the gunwale mortise.
Trace the angle and from it run
the full curve and use this for a pattern
for cutting out the other molds.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 4</span><br>
This Mold is Located near the Centre of a Canoe and
is Made a Trifle Wider</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Mold No. 4 is placed amidships in
the center of the canoe and only one
complete mold is required, as shown
in <a href="#Fig80a">Fig. 5</a>. To make a pattern draw a
rectangle 15 in. long and 12 in. wide,
and divide it into four equal parts as
before. From the No. 3 mold pattern
trace in the mortises for the gunwale,
backbone, and keel. Lay the rule on
the bottom outside line and measure
2 in. from the center line to the left at
D and turn the rule at right angles and<span class="pagenum" id="Page80">[80]</span>
measure off ⁵⁄₁₆ in. inside of the bottom
line and make dot 1. Measure, from D,
1¹⁄₂ in. to E, turn the rule up and measure
off ⁵⁄₈ in. inside the line and make
dot 2. The dot 3 is 1¹⁄₂ in. farther to
the left and 1¹⁄₄ in. inside the line and
dot 4 is 1 in. to the left of 3 and 2 in.
inside of the line. The dot 5 is 1¹⁄₄ in.
to the left of dot 4, and 4 in. inside of
the bottom line, which will bring it
¹⁄₄ in. inside of the left vertical side
line. At a point 2 in. above dot 5 make
dot 6 on the outside vertical line and
1¹⁄₄ in. above it make dot 7. The space
between dots 6 and 7 gives the widest
part of the correct bilge curve. Exactly
3³⁄₄ in. above dot 7 and ¹⁄₄ in.
inside of the vertical side line make dot
8, which marks the beginning of the
bilge curve above the water line and at
the gunwale mortise. The curve of
the canoe floor is quite flat, but not
exactly a straight line. Lay the rule
on the bottom line and measure up, on
the inner edge of the keel mortise, ¹⁄₈
in., then 2¹⁄₂ in. to the left make a mark,
F, ¹⁄₁₆ in. inside the bottom line and a
pencil line drawn between them will
enable one to trace the correct curve.
Having cut out the pattern make two
wood forms exactly alike to have it
complete, as shown. After finishing
the seven complete molds, fasten them
securely together by nailing a couple
of battens across the halves.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 6</span><br>
Straight-Grained Material must be Selected for the
Stems, as It Is Necessary to Bend Them to Shape</p>

</div><!--container-->

<h3>The Ribbands and Stems</h3>

<p>The ribbands are merely strips of
wood, ³⁄₄ in. wide, ¹⁄₂ in. thick, and 14
ft. long. Any cheap stuff will do because
they are only used to give the
correct shape of the canoe curve while
building it. Six ribbands are necessary,
and it is best to use eight lengths
in order to make sure that the ribs are
bent at the required angle and that
both sides of the canoe are ribbed at
the one uniform curve. For the stems
ash or oak, ³⁄₄ in. square, is used, and
straight-grained material must be selected
since it is necessary to bend
them to obtain the requisite curve.</p>

<p>To make the pattern for the stem
mold, shown in <a href="#Fig80b">Fig. 6</a>, draw a rectangle,
24¹⁄₂ in. long by 12 in. wide, and divide
it into four equal parts. Lay the rule
on the left side at the upper corner, at
G, measure down 1 in. and make dot 1.
Lay the rule along the top horizontal
line and measure 2¹⁄₂ in. from G and
make dot 2, then draw a pencil line between
them. From dot 1 measure
along this line exactly ³⁄₄ in., and make
dot 3. From dot 2 measure straight
down 1³⁄₄ in. to H, turn at right angles
and measure off ⁵⁄₈ in. to the right and
make dot 4, and make a pencil line
from 2 to 4 as shown. From dot 2 lay
the rule parallel with the top horizontal
line and measure off 9³⁄₄ in., turn at
right angles and measure down on the
center line 2¹⁄₄ in. and make dot 5.</p>

<p>Lay the rule at the upper right corner
and measure down the vertical line
2³⁄₄ in., turn the rule at right angles
and measure off 3⁷⁄₈ in. and make dot
6. From the upper right-hand corner
measure off 1⁵⁄₈ in. and make dot 7 exactly
¹⁄₄ in. inside the top horizontal
line. Again place the rule at the right-hand
corner, measure down the vertical
line exactly 2 in. and make dot 8.
Draw the line from dot 7 to 8, and ¹⁄₂
in. from dot 8, make dot 9. This gives<span class="pagenum" id="Page81">[81]</span>
the correct contour of the stem where
it joins the splice of the keel.</p>

<div class="container" id="Fig81a">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 7</span><br>
It Is Not Necessary to Make a Paper Pattern for the Keel, or Keelson, as the Piece is Merely Tapered
Uniformly from the Center to Ends, and It can be Drawn Direct on the Board</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The greatest curve and width of the
stem is at J on the lower line. To obtain
the correct curve begin at the upper
left corner and measure from dot 1
down the vertical line 4¹⁄₂ in. to K,
turn the rule at right angles and measure
1¹⁄₄ in. inside the line, and make
dot 10. The dot 11 is placed by measuring
down from K exactly 3¹⁄₄ in.
to L, when the rule is turned at right
angles and a length of 4 in. measured
off inside of the line. The dot 12 is
located in the same manner by measuring
2³⁄₄ in. below L and running 8³⁄₄ in.
inside the line, as shown.</p>

<p>To finish the irregular curve of the
stem, measure from J at the center of
the lower horizontal line 2 in. to M,
turn the rule up and measure off ¹⁄₂ in.
inside of the line, and make dot 13.
The dot 14 is made by measuring off
4 in. from M to N and turning the rule
to a point 3 in. inside the line, as shown.
Then from point N measure to O 1¹⁄₄
in., and then measure up 4 in. to dot 15.
From the dot 14 to 15 run a straight
line. The dot 15 should be exactly 5
in. inside of the right vertical line.</p>

<p>Allowance for the beveled splice of
the stem to the inside keel must now be
made, and the beginning is to run a
light pencil line from dot 15 to dot 6.
From dot 15 measure up ¹⁄₂ in., turn
the rule at P and make dot 16 exactly
¹⁄₄ in. to the left of the upright line.
From dot 16 a line is run to dot 8
which completes the angle of the curve.
The full curve is then easily traced in.</p>

<h3>The Inside Keel, or Keelson</h3>

<p>The inside keel, or keelson, is made
exactly 13 ft. 11 in. long and 3¹⁄₂ in.
wide in the center, which is, of course,
amidships. It is unnecessary to go to
the trouble of making a paper pattern
for this because the keel is merely tapered
uniformly from center to ends,
and this may be drawn on the surface
of the board direct. The board being
13 ft. 11 in. long and 3¹⁄₂ in. wide, it is
only necessary to make cross lines exactly
in the center both ways. From
the center measure 1 ft. toward one
end and make the width at that point
3¹⁄₂ in. Measure 1 ft. farther along,
and again make the width 3¹⁄₂ in. as
before. Continue in this manner, making
the third station 3¹⁄₄ in.; the
fourth, 2⁵⁄₈ in.; the fifth, 2 in.; the sixth,
1¹⁄₄ in., and the width at the ends ¹⁵⁄₁₆
in. This detail is well shown in <a href="#Fig81a">Fig.
7</a>. Bend the stem on the mold and
fasten it to the keel by means of a couple
of ³⁄₄-in. No. 10 screws at each end.</p>

<h3>The Ribs and Gunwales</h3>

<div class="container w45emmax" id="Fig81b">

<img src="images/illo085b.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 8</span><br>
The Ribs are Fastened to the Outside of the Keelson
and are Curved under the Ribbands</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The ribs are best made of cedar, cut
from the same material as the planking.
They are 1³⁄₄ in. wide and ¹⁄₈ in.
thick. It is a good plan to saw out
several long lengths and cut them off
as required, the length being determined
by measuring from gunwale to
gunwale around the curve over the ribbands.
The ribs are put in under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span>
ribbands, and the thickness of the latter
will allow sufficient wood for making
a good fit at the sheer line. The
gunwales are two straight strips, 16
ft. long, ⁷⁄₈ in. wide, and ¹⁄₂
in. thick.</p>

<div class="container w45emmax" id="Fig82a">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 9</span><br>
The Bent Stem is Fastened to the Keel with Screws
at Both Ends</p>

</div><!--container-->

<h3>Setting Up the Canoe</h3>

<p>Having made all the material ready,
the work of setting up the canoe may
begin, and as it is built upside down,
place the backbone on boxes, about 1
ft. or more above the floor, and place
the molds in the numbered places on
the backbone, allowing the backbone
to rest upon the bottom of the mortises
cut in the top of the molds. Study
<a href="#Fig81b">Figs. 8</a> and <a href="#Fig82a">9</a> before beginning the work
of setting up the hull.</p>

<p>True up the molds with a square and
fasten them firmly by toenailing them
to the backbone. Put the keelson in
place, allowing it to fit down in the
mortises cut in the molds to receive it.
Take particular care that the stems are
a good fit with the angle of the backbone
at the ends, then fasten by nailing
through the top edge of the mold
into the stems. As shown in the stem-mold
drawing, <a href="#Fig80b">Fig. 6</a>, the splice where
the stem fits the keelson must be cut
out after it is bent into place. This is
easily done by marking around the outside
edge of the stem and then beveling
from the inside on each side. The
outer edge is left about ¹⁄₈ in. wide, and
the bevel runs out to the width of the
keel at the lower end.</p>

<p>The gunwales are next put on at the
sheer line, and fastened to the molds
and stems, leaving sufficient of the
nails exposed to make them easily
withdrawn later on. The four ribbands
are then put on each side, at equal distances
apart, between the gunwale and
keel, or at 5-in. centers, measuring from
the keel up toward the gunwale. Fasten
the ribbands by driving 1¹⁄₄-in.
brads through them into the mold.
Measure off the keel for the ribs, which
should be put on 3 in. apart, measuring
from the centers. The ribs are fastened
to the outside of the keelson and are
curved under the ribbands. Fasten
each rib to the keel by means of two
⁵⁄₈-in. copper clout nails, then spring
them into place and fasten to the gunwales.
Put in all the ribs in the same
way, spacing them so that a rib will
be placed over each mold. When all
the ribs are put in, remove the ribbands,
and begin planking the hull.</p>

<h3>Planking the Canoe</h3>

<p>As a canoe is planked with ¹⁄₈-in.
cedar it is easily bent to the curve of
the ribs while cold, thus doing away
with the trouble of steaming. Unlike
heavier-planked craft the planking is
not rabbeted at the stem but is nailed
to the beveled surface. For strength
and to give a perfectly smooth skin on
which to lay the canvas, it is advisable
to run the planking the full length from
stem to stem. Begin by putting on
the garboard strake, which is the bottom
plank at the keel. Punch holes in
the plank with an awl, not directly in
line, but staggered from side to side
along the ribs. This will prevent the
possibility of splitting. Drive in the
copper clout nails while the plank is
kept in place with a clamp to facilitate
the work. Hold a clinch iron, or any
handy piece of iron, inside and clinch
the nails so that the ends are well imbedded<span class="pagenum" id="Page83">[83]</span>
in the rib on the inside. It is
a simple matter to fit each plank in
place, because they are merely a close
fit at the edge, butted together without
beveling. The number of planks
required will depend upon the width,
and while wider strips may be used,
planking cut to the width of 3 in. is
generally employed. In any case the
top plank or sheer strake should be
level with the gunwale from one stem
to the other. When the hull is completely
planked, cut off the ends of the
planking to the curve of the stems and
gunwales. The backbone and molds
may now be taken out by sawing the
backbone in two. Tack a couple of
strips across the gunwales to keep the
hull from sagging out of shape, then
drive the nails over the sections the
molds occupied, since these forms prevented
doing this work before.</p>

<h3>Seat Risings and Seats</h3>

<p>The seat risings are simply straight
sticks, ¹⁄₂ in. square, and are fastened
on the inside for the seats to rest upon.
They are about 4 in. below the gunwale.
Oak or ash is the best material,
and the length is 14 ft. To fasten in
place, first bore a small hole and then
nail through the planking and ribs, and
clinch on the inside of the rising.</p>

<p>The seat frame is fashioned as shown
in <a href="#Fig82b">Fig. 10</a>, and may be caned, or a
canvas seat tacked on, as preferred.
Many canoeists prefer to kneel, in
which case a seat bar, about 4 or 5 in.
wide, is run athwartships for the paddler’s
back and thighs to rest against
while paddling.</p>

<h3>The Deck Beams and Decks</h3>

<p>The deck beams are merely straight
pieces, about 8 in. long, 1¹⁄₈ in. wide,
and ³⁄₈ in. thick. These are notched at
the ends as shown in <a href="#Fig83a">Fig. 11</a>, so that
they will come up and wedge against
the sides of the gunwales about ¹⁄₂ in.
Put them in by boring a hole through
the gunwale and fasten with a 1¹⁄₄-in.
No. 10 screw at each end. Two are required,
one at each end.</p>

<p class="caption">The Shape of the Deck or Breast Hooks and the

</div><!--container-->

<p>The deck, or breast, hooks are made
16 in. long by 8 in. wide and of the
shape shown in <a href="#Fig83b">Fig. 12</a>. To fasten
them in place bore three holes through
the deck into the deck beam and secure
them with three 1¹⁄₄-in. No. 10
screws. Bore three holes along the
gunwale on each side and turn three
1¹⁄₄-in. No. 10 screws into the deck.</p>

<h3>A Center Thwart</h3>

<p>To strengthen and stiffen the hull a
center thwart, or cross bar, should be
run across the canoe amidships. A
piece of oak or ash, ³⁄₈ in. thick and
tapering from 2 in. in the center to 1
in. at the ends, should be screwed
to the lower side of the gunwale.
Although not exactly essential, it is a
good plan to run another thwart across
the canoe just back of the forward seat,
and a rear thwart some 3 ft. forward of
the rear seat, or paddling bar. This
will make the craft very stiff when a
heavy load is carried, and likewise prevent
the lightly constructed hull from
sagging, or “hogging,” when stored for
the winter.</p>

<img src="images/illo087c.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 13</span><br>
The Manner of Shaping the Ends of the Canvas to
Fit over the Canoe Ends</p>

</div><!--container-->

<h3>Applying the Canvas</h3>

<p>The canvas is put on with marine
glue, the black kind being the best for<span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span>
this particular purpose. Before gluing
the canvas, lay it smoothly on the hull
and trim so that it will fold nicely at
the stems, as shown in <a href="#Fig83c">Fig. 13</a>. Melt
the glue in a can over a moderately hot
fire and spread it on one side of the
canvas with a stiff brush. Of course,
the glue will be too thick to spread
evenly, but be sure to apply it as evenly
as possible, and touch every bit of the
canvas with a fairly heavy coating of
glue. Lay the glued canvas in place,
and iron with a moderately hot flatiron.
This melts the glue, and the canvas will
adhere smoothly to the planking. Finish
by tacking the edge of the canvas
along the edge of the gunwales, and
fold the canvas as smoothly as possible
at the stem, and tack in place, running
the line of tacks exactly down
the center line of the stem.</p>

<h3>Fenders or Covering Strips</h3>

<p>Fenders of ¹⁄₂-in. round molding may
be tacked on to cover the edge of the
canvas, or a strip, 1 in. wide, may be
sawed from the same material as the
planking and tacked to cover the edge
by using 1¹⁄₄-in. brads every 2 or 3 in.
along the edge.</p>

<h3>Stem Bands and Outside Keel</h3>

<p>The stem bands may be made from
wood if desired and bent to shape, but
the brass oval stem or bang iron, ³⁄₈ in.
wide, makes a stronger and better finish.
The wood stem band should be
about ³⁄₈ in. square, and rounded on the
outside. Put this on with 1¹⁄₄-in. brads
and fasten the brass band with ³⁄₄-in.
screws.</p>

<p>The outside keel may or may not be
used, according to preference. It
strengthens the canoe to a certain extent
and keeps the bottom from many
a scratch while pulling out. The usual
outside keel is about 1 in. wide and ¹⁄₂
in. thick, of oak or ash, and tapered at
the stems to the width of the stem
bands, which are screwed on over it.
The most serviceable keel is about 2¹⁄₂
in. wide in the center, and tapers to fit
the bands at either end. When made
of ³⁄₄-in. oak, or ash, it makes a splendid
protection for the bottom of the
hull, especially when the craft is used
in rocky waters. Unlike the narrow
keel, the flat keel makes the canoe
easier to turn with the paddle, but any
form of keel will add several pounds to
the weight of the craft and is for this
reason often omitted.</p>

<h3>Painting the Canoe</h3>

<p>The canvas should be given a coat of
shellac before the paint is applied. This
makes it waterproof. Then four coats
of paint are applied to fill the fibers of
the canvas. To make a smooth finishing
coat, rub down the second and third
coats with fine sandpaper. The entire
woodwork of the canoe should be finished
with three coats of good-quality
outside spar varnish.</p>

<p>A slatted grating, made of soft-pine
lattice stuff, about 1¹⁄₈ in. wide and
1¹⁄₄ in. thick, will afford protection to
the bottom of the canoe. For summer
use this is desirable, but may be
omitted on long trips and when soft
footwear is worn. The grating should
not be fastened to the ribs, but the
parallel strips screwed, or nailed, to
cross strips, curved to fit the contour
of the canoe’s bottom. The grating
should extend from well under the
stern seat up to the stem splice in the
bow, and should be nicely tapered to
make a neat appearance. By fastening
two or three little blocks of wood so
that they will extend up between the
slats, one may screw small brass buttons
into these blocks to keep the slatted
floor in place, thus making it easily
removable when washing out the canoe.</p>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">S</span><span class="afterlargecap">ailing</span> and its recreations are
afforded the owner of an open
paddling canoe, for a satisfactory
sailing rig may be provided at small
cost. A regulation sailing outfit may
be purchased, but it is rather costly,
and if the canoeist cannot use a sail
frequently, purchasing an outfit is unduly
expensive. A sailing rig may be
constructed even by one of only moderate
skill, who will devote a few hours
to it. The specifications given, if carefully
followed, will enable one to make
a sailing rig as serviceable as a ready-made
outfit, and at about one-half the
cost.</p>

<p>The specifications and list of material
for a sailing outfit suitable for a
16-ft. open canoe are as follows:</p>

<p class="stufflist">1 piece bamboo, 1¹⁄₂ in. in diameter, 6 ft. 10 in.
long, for mast.</p>

<p class="stufflist">2 pieces bamboo fishing rod, 1 in. at butt, 10 ft.
long.</p>

<p class="stufflist">1 piece, cedar or white pine, 5 ft. long, 4 in. wide,
and ⁷⁄₈ in. thick, for leeboard thwart.</p>

<p class="stufflist">2 pieces, cedar or pine, 28 in. long, 10 in. wide,
and ³⁄₈ in. thick, for mast thwart.</p>

<p class="stufflist">1 piece, cedar or pine, 27¹⁄₂ in. long, 3¹⁄₂ in. wide,
and ³⁄₄ in. thick, for mast thwart.</p>

<p class="stufflist">1 piece, cedar or pine, 5 in. long, 2¹⁄₂ in. wide, and
1 in. thick, for mast step.</p>

<p class="stufflist">8 yd. unbleached cotton sheeting, 1 yd. wide, for
making sail.</p>

<p class="stufflist">30 ft. ¹⁄₄-in. cotton rope, for halyard and main sheet.</p>

<p class="stufflist">4 brass lantern-board hooks, for clamping mast
thwart and leeboard thwart to canoe.</p>

<p class="stufflist">2 brass stove bolts, 3 in. long and ⁵⁄₁₆ in. diameter,
with washers and thumb nuts, for clamping
leeboards at desired angle.</p>

<p class="stufflist">1 brass single-boom jaw for canoe, 2 in. long, for
keeping boom on mast.</p>

<p class="stufflist">3 brass screw eyes, 1¹⁄₂ in. long with ¹⁄₂-in. eye,
one for halyard, two for spars.</p>

<p class="stufflist">1 brass split ring, 1¹⁄₂ in., for fastening ends of
spars together.</p>

<p class="stufflist">1 brass “S” hook, 1³⁄₄ in. long, for fastening ends
of spars.</p>

<p>In converting the paddling canoe for
sailing, it is desirable that it be unmarred,
as far as possible. The rig
described represents the result of experiments
with various arrangements,
and has been found to be safe and convenient.
The original outfit has been
in use for six years and will still serve
for some time.</p>

<p>The lateen rig is best for an open
canoe, because a shorter mast is required
for the same sail area. An open
craft is less suited for carrying sail
than one which is decked fore, aft, and
amidships. It is not safe to rig a canoe
too heavily, and the rig described has
been found to be well proportioned.</p>

<p>Bamboo is best for the mast, because
it is lighter and tougher than a
solid wood spar of the same dimensions,
and is readily procured. Dealers
in rugs use bamboo of 1¹⁄₂ to 2-in.
diameter on which to roll carpets, and
it may usually be purchased of them.</p>

<p>Cut the bamboo to a length of 6 ft.
10 in., and whittle a wooden plug,
about 3 in. long, tapering it so that
it will wedge firmly inside, taking care
not to split the cane. Bore a small
hole through the cane 2 in. from the
top, plug it and fix a screw eye
into the plug. Drive small brads
through the cane into the plug to prevent
the former from splitting. A
brass ferrule fitted over the end of the
bamboo will make a strong and neat
finish.</p>

<p>The sail is made in the form of a
triangle and measures 9 ft. on each
side. It is best to have it sewed on a
machine. The sail is bighted with
parallel strips, or folds, ¹⁄₂ in. wide,
spaced 6 in. apart, as shown at the left
in the illustration. First cut the canvas
to the approximate size and shape
by laying the spars over it and marking
the outline with a pencil. Next
sew the separate widths together, lapping
one edge over the other about ¹⁄₂
in., and sewing close to both edges.
The bights or folds run at an angle and
parallel with the loose ends of the
leech of the sail. The sail should then
be reinforced at the corners by sewing
segments of cloth at these points.
Along the edges which are to be lashed
to the spars, fold over a strip of canvas
and sew it to make a 1-in. hem.
Run a ¹⁄₂-in. tape into the fold along
the leech while sewing the hem. This
tape is fastened to the spar at each
end, to take up the slack caused by
the stretching of the sail after use,
thus preventing that bugbear of sailors—a
flapping leech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page88">[88]</span></p>

<p>The mast thwart is made as shown
at the right in the <a href="#Fig87">illustration</a>, and has
a hole cut in the center to fit the mast.
It is also provided with two lantern-board
hooks, one at each end, with
which to clamp the thwart to the gunwales.
The mast is supported at the
bottom by means of the mast step,
which is a block of wood, shaped as
shown to give a neat appearance. It
is fastened to the grating, or to the
ribs if no grating is used.</p>

<p>The leeboard thwart is also shown
in the <a href="#Fig87">sketch</a>, at the right. The short
upright ends are set at an angle so that
they conform to the curve of the canoe
and wedge the thwart into place immediately
aft of the mast. The ends
are grooved to fit the thwart and fastened
with screws. A carriage bolt is
fitted through each end piece and provided
with a wing nut, which holds the
leeboard in place on each side. The
leeboards may thus be adjusted at the
desired angle by fixing them with
wing nuts. No dimensions are given,
for it is obvious that they will vary on
different styles and sizes of canoes. A
finish in keeping with that of the canoe
should be applied. Smooth all the
work as carefully as possible with
sharp tools and sandpaper it lightly.
Three coats of spar varnish will give
a satisfactory finish.</p>

<p>The sail is hoisted by running the
halyard through the screw eye at the
top of the mast, until the gaff spar is
close to the mast top, as illustrated.</p>

<p>The boom jaw is fastened on the
boom, with the open end 18 in. from
the forward end of the boom. This
will permit the forefoot of the sail to
extend forward of the mast. By tying
the halyard at various points along the
gaff, the point of balance may be
found. For the sake of safety the halyard
should not be tied to the forward
thwart, but run under it to the stern
within easy reach of the canoeist. The
main sheet should never be made fast,
but the rope merely looped around the
thwart and held in the hand or beneath
the foot, so that it may be released
quickly if a puff of wind should strike
the sail.</p>

<p>Steering is done with a paddle. This
method is more convenient than a rudder
where the single sail is used. The
paddle is always used on the lee side—away
from the wind—and the wake
keeps the blade close to the side of the
canoe, without much effort on the part
of the person guiding it. When turning
about make the regular paddling
stroke, but finish it by thrusting the
blade of the paddle away from the
canoe. This will tend to keep the
canoe in its course, and the paddle will
not be drawn across the wake, which
would affect the headway of the craft.</p>

<p>The lower the weight is placed in a
canoe, or boat, the greater will be its
stability. Hence, in sailing a canoe, sit
on the floor of the craft, and when
turning about, turn against the wind
and not with it. The experienced canoeist
can shift his course readily, but
the novice must be cautious, even in a
moderate breeze. It would be well to
sail in shallow water and to wear only
bathing costume when learning to sail
a canoe. When tacking and sailing
close-hauled the leeboard is the most
effective, but as the boards are thin
both may be kept down without greatly
reducing the speed. When running
before the wind both boards may be
raised to give the greatest speed.</p>

Fitting a Motor into a Paddling Canoe</p>

</div><!--illotext-->

</div><!--container-->

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">A</span> <span class="afterlargecap">stanchly</span> built canoe of sufficient
length and beam may be
converted into a light, serviceable,
and convenient power boat by the installation
of a light-weight motor of
about 2 hp. While the craft thus becomes
less available for shallow waters
and cannot be used so readily on
trips where portages are necessary,
a power canoe has advantages in that
longer trips may be undertaken with
less regard for weather conditions.
Greater speed and the fact that physical
power need not be expended also
increase the value and range of operations
of such a craft.</p>

<p>Unless a motor of extremely light
weight is procured, a canoe of frail
construction and less than 16 ft. long
is not likely to stand the jar of the
driving mechanism. The canoe illustrated
in the <a href="#Fig91">page plate</a> is 18 ft. long,
of 36-in. beam, and strongly planked,
decked, and braced. A canoe of even
broader beam would tend to give more
stability in rough water, and if it is desired
to transport heavy camping packs,
or other material, in the craft, this factor
should be observed particularly.
Likewise, the depth and draft must be
considered, as the carrying capacity
and seaworthiness of a canoe depend
in part on these factors. The fitting of
the various parts of the mechanism and
accessories must be done with the aim
of balancing the load evenly. If properly
disposed, the weight of these parts
should tend to lower the center of gravity
of the canoe, thus rendering it more
stable.</p>

<p>The actual work of installing the
motor and fittings should be preceded
by careful planning and the making
of a full-size diagram of the stern
portion of the canoe as rebuilt. Too
much care cannot be taken in this work,
as, if it is neglected, the craft may be
rendered unsafe, or the motor and fittings
may not operate satisfactorily.
The motor should be set in the stern,
as shown in the <a href="#Fig91">illustration</a>, as this will
permit the use of a minimum of shafting
and other fittings which must be
accommodated. The exact location of
the motor may vary with canoes and
engines of different types. This should
be tested out by placing the motor in
the canoe and noting the effect on its
balance in the water. For a canoe of
the dimensions indicated, and a light-weight
motor, 5 ft. from the stern is
a satisfactory position. The motor
should be placed as low in the canoe
as possible, allowing the flywheel and
crank case sufficient clearance below.</p>

<p>A convenient method of operation is
as follows: Place the canoe on boxes,
or sawhorses, taking care that it is
properly supported about 2 ft. from the
ground, or floor. Take measurements
directly from the canoe, or part to be
fitted, whenever convenient. Procure
two sheets of paper, 30 in. wide and
7 ft. long; mark one “diagram” and
the other “templates,” and use the
former for the full-size detail and the
other for the making of templates for
curved or irregular parts.</p>

<p>Begin the diagram by drawing the
base line AB, <a href="#Fig91">Fig. 3</a>. This is the lower
line of the engine bed and the upper
surface of the ribs. Draw the line CD
perpendicular to the base line, and 18
in. from the left end of the sheet. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page90">[90]</span>
point C is the center of the stern end
of the driving shaft. The dimensions
of parts are not given, except in special
instances, since they must be obtained
from the particular canoe and
other parts entering into the construction.
Indicate the layer of ribs E, the
planking F, and the keel G. Using
the template sheet, cut a template or
pattern for the curved stern. This
may be readily and accurately done by
fixing a straightedge to the keel and
permitting it to extend to A. Rest the
long edge of the sheet on the straightedge
when fitting the template to the
curve. Use the template as a guide in
marking the curve on the diagram, as
at HJ. The curve K, of the stern decking,
may be indicated similarly.</p>

<p>Determine the distance the motor is
to be set from the stern and indicate
it by the perpendicular line L. Measuring
from the base line, indicate the
height of the center of the motor shaft
from the floor, as at M. This should be
made as low as possible, permitting
sufficient clearance for the flywheel
and the crank case. Draw a straight
line from C to M, which will thus indicate
the center line of the driving
shaft. This line is fundamental in determining
the dimensions and placing
of certain parts and fittings, and should
be established with extreme care. The
size and exact position of the engine
bed N may now be indicated. Its dimensions,
given in detail in the perspective
sketch, <a href="#Fig91">Fig. 5</a>, are suggestive
only. They may be varied in order to
provide proper bearing on the floor,
and so that the bolts holding the bed
may pass through ribs. The cross
brace at the forward end is important,
and should be fitted carefully over a
rib. The upper line of the engine bed
must not be confounded with the center
line of the shaft, for in many engines
they are on a horizontal line
when viewed from the forward end,
yet not necessarily so. The slant of
the engine bed must be made accurately,
as any deflection from the angle
of the center line of the shaft will disarrange
the installation.</p>

<p>The shaft log O may next be indicated
and a template made for use in
guiding the bit when boring the hole
for the shaft through it. The template
used for the curve HJ may be altered
by drawing the shaft log on it at the
proper place. The point P, from which
the bit is to be started when the shaft
log is fixed into place, should be indicated
and the center line of the shaft
extended to Q, may then be used as a
guide for the bit. If the homemade
type of bearing R is used, it should
be indicated on the diagram. A metal
bearing may be made, or a suitable
one obtained from dealers in marine
hardware. In the latter case it will
probably be necessary to block up the
bottom of the canoe in order to provide
a flat, horizontal bearing surface for
the bearing flange.</p>

<p>The rudder and other parts, which
are not directly connected with the
motive-power unit, may be indicated
in detail on the diagram or be made
from sketches of a smaller scale. Paper
patterns, made full size, offer a
convenient method of outlining the
parts of the engine bed, the rudder, and
other irregular pieces. When the diagram
is complete, measurements may
be transferred directly from it without
reducing them to figures, and, wherever
possible, parts should be fitted to it.</p>

<p>The shaft log, shaft bearing, and engine
bed may be made of oak, or other
strong hard wood. It will be found
desirable to have the engine bed complete
before an attempt is made to fit
the shaft and its connections. It is made
of 1¹⁄₂-in. stock, bolted together with
lag screws and fixed firmly into the
canoe with bolts. The heads of the
bolts should be provided with cotton
and red-lead packing, and care should
be taken that the bolts pass through
ribs.</p>

<p>The shaft log should be fixed into
place before it is bored. Bolts may
be passed through it and fastened on
the inside if there is room for drawing
up the nuts in the stern. Large screws
may be used to aid in the fastening
and smaller screws may be used from
the inside. The lower rudder support
will also aid in holding the log in place,
and the iron straps S, <a href="#Fig91">Fig. 3</a>, will insure
its rigidity. This is an important point
in the construction, as if the log is not
fixed positively, the thrashing of the
propeller will soon loosen it.</p>

<p>A detail of the shaft bearing R is
shown in <a href="#Fig91">Fig. 4</a>. The hole to receive
the shaft must be bored accurately, and
the use of the template, as with the
boring of the shaft log, is advisable.
Flanged metal bearings are provided to
take up the wear in the bearing block.
The method of fastening the block, as
shown in the detail view, insures a
rigid bearing with a minimum of holes
through the bottom of the canoe. A
U-bolt, T, binds the double angle brace
U and the block firmly to the keel.
The angles of the brace are fixed into
the sides of the canoe with bolts, and
a bolt at the stern end of the block
supports it further. The block should
be placed so that it will bear on three
ribs and must be fitted to the curve
of the canoe.</p>

<p>The rudder is made of sheet metal
supported on a rod or pipe. Its general
dimensions are shown in <a href="#Fig91">Fig. 2</a>.
The fan of the rudder is riveted to its
supports and rests in a bearing strip
of ¹⁄₄ by 1-in. strap iron, which is
shaped as a guard for the propeller.
The upper bearing of the rudder post is
formed from a strip of iron, bolted to
the stern, and the upper guide bar, to
which the ropes are attached, is cut
from an iron strip.</p>

<p>The propeller is 8 in. in diameter,
but may be installed of a size suitable
to the power, speed, and type of the
motor used. The stuffing box V, <a href="#Fig91">Fig.
2</a>, the bearings for the bearing block
R, the intake strainer W, the exhaust
outlet X, <a href="#Fig91">Fig. 1</a>, and the shaft coupling
Y are all of manufactured types that
may be purchased of marine-supply
houses.</p>

<p>The intake strainer W is placed in
the bottom directly below the pump
Z. The exhaust outlet X is placed
above the water line, and a muffler
should be installed to avoid noise from
the exhaust explosions. The exhaust
may be conducted under water or to a
point near the stern. No indication is
given for the placing of the gasoline
tank, the supply pipes, electrical-energy
source, and wiring. The tank may be
placed in the stern of the canoe high
enough to provide a good flow. A
magneto may be used to give current
for the sparking circuit, or batteries
may be provided. They may be placed
at any point convenient, and should be
incased in a waterproof container.</p>

<p>In assembling the parts care must
be taken not to wrench the shaft or
other pieces out of line, and in general,
it is well to fix nonadjustable parts
solidly when they are fitted into place.
This applies particularly to the engine
bed and the shaft log. The bearing
block may be adjusted vertically by
adding packing, or by reducing the
lower surface. The rudder and its fittings
may be made in regular course,
but should not be fitted until the power
unit and driving mechanism is in place
finally. The propeller may be protected
from possible injury by laying
it aside until needed. All the openings
in the hull through which bolts or other
fastenings are placed should be packed
with red lead or other waterproof packing.
The working parts and finished
metal surfaces should be oiled or
greased thoroughly as the parts are assembled,
and the unfinished metal
parts painted with red lead. This will
protect them from moisture and aid in
the smooth operation of the mechanism.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">How to Make a Fluorescent Screen</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Many experimenters have occasion
to use a fluorescent screen, particularly
those interested in X-ray work. Such
a device is quite expensive if purchased,
and may be made as follows:</p>

<p>Mix 1 oz. each of common salt, sodium
tungstate, and calcium chloride.
Place the mixture in a crucible and
heat it dull red in a coal fire, for several
hours. It will melt into a clear liquid,
and should then be removed and permitted
to cool. The liquid will crystallize
into a hard glasslike mass.
Break this out of the crucible and crush
it into small pieces. Put them into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page93">[93]</span>
jar of clear water. The sodium chloride
resulting from the chemical change
by heating, will gradually dissolve and
the calcium tungstate will fall to the
bottom in fine crystals. Wash this
precipitate until all trace of the salt
disappears; then pour the crystals
upon a sheet of filter or blotting paper
to dry. After drying, place them in a
mortar and grind them to a fine powder,
when they will be ready for use.</p>

<p>To make the screen proper, procure
a piece of thin white cardboard of the
size desired. The calendered board
known as three-ply is satisfactory.
Paint the cardboard on one side with a
thick solution of gum arabic in water,
or better still, with celluloid dissolved
in amyl acetate. Permit the gum to become
“tacky” before dusting with the
chemical. The latter process requires
care, to produce an even layer on the
cardboard, and it is advisable to practice
with ordinary salt before attempting
it on the cardboard for the screen.
The calcium tungstate should be
placed in a dry jar, and a piece of fine
muslin fixed over the mouth of it. The
chemical may be dusted over the surface
with this sieve jar.</p>

<p>Shake off the superfluous crystals
and permit the screen to dry thoroughly.
Fasten a piece of mica, or
sheet celluloid, over the sensitized surface
to prevent damage to it. Mount
the sensitized cardboard in a wooden
frame of suitable size and arrange a
hood around its edges to cut out unnecessary
light. The sensitive side of
the screen is, of course, held toward the
observer when the apparatus is used.—Contributed

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">T</span><span class="afterlargecap">he</span> charm of the birchen canoe
has long been sung in verse and
prose, and while the bark that the
Indian used has been supplanted by
a more perfect type of modern manufacture,
the popularity of this, the most
graceful of water craft, has increased
with years, until today we find the
canoe the choice of thousands of recreation
seekers who paddle about in
park lakes and quiet streams, or spend
their vacations in cruising down rivers
and other attractive waterways—sometimes
within the environs of towns and
villages, and again dipping paddles in
the wilderness streams of the far
north. True, the modern canoe is a
distinct product of the twentieth century,
and while it is so largely used at
summer resorts, it nevertheless retains
all the good points of the old,
while embodying numerous improvements
which fit it even better for wilderness
travel than the Indian model
after which it was patterned. The
noteworthy increase in the number of
canoeists in the past dozen years is
good evidence that this natty craft is
fast coming into its own, and as more
and more outdoor men and women
understand its possibilities and limitations
and become proficient in handling
it, the long-rooted fear and distrust
with which the uninformed public regard
the canoe, will pass away. As a
matter of fact, accidents ever follow
in the wake of ignorance and carelessness,
and while there are very few expert
gunners injured by firearms, and
still fewer experienced canoeists
drowned, there are numerous sad accidents
constantly occurring to the reckless
and foolhardy, who do not know
how to handle a weapon, nor understand
the first thing about paddling a
canoe. Let us consider then, the practical
side of the subject, the choice of
a suitable canoe and the knack of
handling it in a safe and efficient
manner.</p>

<p>If one would experience in full
measure the many-sided charm of
paddling, he should get a good canoe.
Unlike other and heavier water craft,
the canoe is a lightly balanced and
responsive conveyance, which may be
cranky and dangerous, or safe and
stable, according to the model, the skill
of the builder, and the dexterity of the
paddler. There are canoes and canoes,
of varying models and sizes, and constructed
of many materials, and while
all may serve as a means of getting
about in the water, the paddling qualities
include numerous little idiosyncrasies
which serve to differentiate
canoes as well as men. In fact, this
light and graceful craft may be properly
viewed as the highest type of boat
building, since it must be fashioned
strong but light; it must be steady
when going light; capable of carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page96">[96]</span>
comparatively heavy loads; draw little
water, and it must be honestly constructed
of good material to stand up
under the hard usage which every
canoe is subjected to, whether used for
summer paddling, or upon long hunting
and shooting trips.</p>

<p>Three types of canoes are in common
use by experienced canoeists, the birch-bark,
the all-wood, and the canvas-covered
cedar canoe. The birch-bark,
by reason of its rougher workmanship,
is slow under the paddle, is easily injured,
and it grows heavier and more
difficult to handle every time it is used.
The all-wood canoe is most expensive
to buy, and though swift under the
paddle, is too easily injured and too
difficult to repair for rough and ready
use. The cedar-planked canoe which
is covered with filled and painted canvas
is for many reasons the best all-around
craft-attractive enough for
park use, and stout enough for use in
rapid water and for cruising in northern
lakes and rivers.</p>

<h3>How to Select a Birch-Bark Canoe</h3>

<p>The Indian-made birch-bark canoe
costs about $1 a foot and is fashioned
of birch bark over an ash, or spruce,
frame. The bark is not nailed to the
frame, but is sewed together with
boiled spruce, or tamarack, roots, split
to a suitable size. To give the proper
shape to the canoe a double row of
stakes are firmly planted in the ground
and the spruce frame is sprung between
them. The bark is put on inside
out, and the work of sewing together
is done while the bark is fresh, or
immediately after it is stripped from
the tree. The seams are afterward
made water-tight by smearing well
with spruce gum, which hardens quickly
and makes a fairly good joint. The
Indian model is a good one so far as
the freeboard, width of beam, and flaring
stems are concerned, but the curved
bottom makes it extremely cranky and
dangerous for the novice to handle. Be
sure to see that the birch-bark canoe
is fashioned with a flat, straight bottom,
which makes the craft steadier
and less inclined to veer about under
the stroke of the paddle. In an expert’s
hands the round bottom will be found
a decided advantage, making it faster
to paddle and more easily turned and
steered in swift and rough water.
Many prefer the three-piece bottom,
but the bottom made of a single piece
of bark is stronger and less likely to
open up and leak. All birch canoes
will warp and twist somewhat, and it
is practically impossible to find one
that is straight and true. The birch-bark
canoe has many limitations and
not a few weaknesses, but if one has
the good luck to find a good one, and
treats it fairly, it will prove a safe and
dry craft for many hundreds of miles’
travel. Of course, one must carry a
kettle of pitch for making repairs, and
be content to travel somewhat slower
than with modern canoes, but this may
not be a disadvantage. Birch canoes
have no seats, as the Indian kneels
when paddling, but a low thwart, or
seat, is easy to put in at the bow and
stern, if one prefers the white man’s
paddling position.</p>

<h3>All-Wood or Peterborough Canoe</h3>

<p>This type of craft is much used in
Canada along the St. Lawrence River,
and to a much less extent by American
sportsmen, owing to its higher cost,
and its tendency to break and cause a
leak. Of course, the all-wood canoe
is a good craft, but everything considered,
there can be no question in
the minds of canoeists who are acquainted
with all types of canoes, that
the all-cedar or basswood craft is less
dependable than the canvas-covered
cedar canoe. The Peterborough type—so
called from a Canadian city of
this name where many wood canoes
are made—with its relatively low ends
and straight sides with but little sheer
and tumble home, is the model commonly
used by practically all manufacturers
of the all-wood canoe. While
a boat of this kind can be, and often is,
used in rough-water lake paddling as
well as in wilderness travel, the all-wood
canoe is better suited for club
use, and in the wider and more quiet-flowing
streams and lakes.</p>

<h3>The Canvas-Covered Cedar Canoe</h3>

<p>The canvas-covered cedar canoe,
when rightly made of the best material,
is by all odds the best paddling
craft afloat, being strong and light,
with a hull so smooth that it is swift
to paddle, while the mode of construction
makes a very stiff craft, which will
not warp or twist out of shape. Moreover,
it will stand a vast amount of
hard usage and abuse, while repairs
are quickly and neatly done by the
stream side. In the making of a first-class
canoe of this type, the ribs are
first steamed and then bent and fitted
over a solid form; cedar being used for
the ribs and planking; spruce for the
gunwales, and white ash, or oak, for
the stems and thwarts. In a canoe
built according to my instructions,
each plank runs to the full length of
the craft and all are beveled and
lapped together, thus making a perfectly
smooth and almost water-tight
canoe, before the canvas is cemented
on its surface. The canvas is thoroughly
waterproofed before it is put
on, then it is drawn tightly over the
planking, and several coats of filler
and the final finish of paint are applied,
after which it is rubbed down.</p>

<p>The well-made canvas-covered canoe
is, if properly designed, a pretty good
facsimile of the representative Indian
model in that it possesses all the good
points of the birch-bark canoe, but is
more substantially constructed, of better
and more durable material, and
more finely finished. In making the
selection, it is necessary to pay a fair
price to obtain a good craft, and while
various manufacturers supply canoes
of similar types at different prices,
some of them are so inferior that they
will scarcely stand a season’s use. Of
course, the use to which a canoe is put
will influence the selection. If the
craft is wanted for long service on
hunting and fishing trips, a high-grade
canoe of plain finish is the logical
choice. If the canoe is for club use, a
highly finished craft with mahogany
trimmings may be preferred. A canoe
for occasional use on some quiet lake
or small stream may be selected from
the cheaper kinds, which will, no doubt,
answer every purpose. However,
most manufacturers list what they call
an “A” and a “B” grade. The “A”
grade provides selected-cedar ribs and
planking; oak for gunwales, stems,
thwarts and seats selected from the
finest material, and the finish the best
that can be procured, while the “B”
grade is identical in model, canvas and
paint, but the material not quite so
clear or free from minor defects, though
for all practical purposes it will render
as much service and give fully as much
satisfaction as the first, or “A,” grade.
A little saving may be made by selecting
the second-grade canoe, having
most of the money invested in the
canoe and not so much in the finer
finishings. The ordinary construction
provides for the ordinary solid topwale,
but the open gunwale is sometimes preferred,
because the openings make
washing easy, all sand and dirt running
out freely between the wales. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span>
construction detail is supplied by most
manufacturers, when specified, at a
slight additional cost.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<h3>Points to be Considered</h3>

<p>The particular shape, combined with
the dimensions, of the canoe is commonly
called the model, and since
many canoe builders offer several
different models it is a comparatively
easy matter to find a craft which fully
meets one’s ideas of a canoe. Canoes
can be had as small as 10 ft. long
and weighing as little as 18 lb., while
others are built all the way up to
35 ft. and ranging around 50 in. wide.
For all-around use, that is for cruising,
hunting, and fishing, the 16-ft.
length, with 32-in. beam, 12 in. deep
amidships, and weighing about 60 lb.,
will meet the approval of the experienced
canoeist. In a good canoe of
this size a flat floor, medium-high
ends, and a fair amount of tumble
home—to add stability and keep the
water from shooting inboard—may be
reckoned the “earmarks” of a general-purpose
craft. For exclusive river
work, where many rapids are encountered,
a lightly rounded bottom, a
trifle lower in the center than at the
ends, will be easier to handle in white
water, while comparatively narrow
ends will give more speed under the
paddle.</p>

<p>All canvas-covered canoes are provided
with brass bang plates, or irons,
at stern and bow, and if wanted, an
outside keel may be furnished. In
most cases this is not essential, but
when the canoe is largely used in rocky
rivers a broad keel of ¹⁄₂-in. oak, or ash,
2¹⁄₂ in. wide in the center and tapered
at both ends to fit the brass bang irons,
will protect the bottom from hard
knocks. The narrow 1-in. keel is an
out-and-out nuisance, making the
canoe slow to turn and furnishing but
scant protection for the bottom. Any
keel adds to the weight of the craft,
and weight is a factor that must be
considered when much portaging is
done. So far as capacity is concerned,
a canoe, 16 ft. long, 32-in. beam, and
12-in. amidship depth, will accommodate
two men and the usual amount
of camp duffle, weighing from 350 to
400 lb. On short trips, a 15-ft. canoe
may be made to accommodate two men,
while on very long cruises, where a
larger amount of duffle must be taken
along, an 18-ft. canoe may be needed.
For three persons, the 17 or 18-ft.
canoe, of 34-in. beam, is about right,
but for a party of four it is better to use
two 16-ft. canoes than one large craft.
In fact, canoes longer than 18 ft. are
more properly regarded as freight craft
and only used on special trips.</p>

<p>Moccasins, or rubber-soled footwear,
are most suitable for the canoeist’s
wear, but since heavy-heeled shoes are
often worn, it is a good plan to protect
the thin planking by running a slatted
floor, 8 or 10 in. wide, in the center of
the canoe. Provide this grating with
brass buttons, and it will be held firmly
in place, but removable at any time.
For convenience in towing, a small but
flexible rope—braided cotton is always
soft and pliable—about 20 ft. long,
should be tied at both bow and stern.
The ordinary “painter eye,” which
fastens with a bolt screwed to the under<span class="pagenum" id="Page99">[99]</span>
side of the breast hooks, is good,
but a small hole, through which the
rope is securely knotted, will serve as
well.</p>

<h3>Paddles</h3>

<p>The best material for paddles is good
selected spruce, and while this material
is not so heavy nor will stand
hard knocks so well as maple or birch,
its lightness makes it the choice of
many paddlers. For rough work the
maple paddle may be chosen, and while
heavier than spruce, it possesses greater
elasticity, and this spring offsets to
a great extent the larger weight of material.
Cedar, ash, and pine make excellent
paddles, and the Indians often
fashion them from these woods.</p>

<p>In selecting a single-blade paddle, it
is well to remember that the length will
depend on the paddler’s height, for it
is self-evident that a tall man will require
a longer paddle than a short person
can conveniently swing. Hence the
usual rule is to pick out a paddle as
long as the paddler is tall, and is a
sensible one to follow, although there
are exceptions. Personal preferences
differ, and, also, a longer paddle will be
required when paddling from seats than
when a kneeling position is adopted.
For general use, the stern paddle of
5¹⁄₂-ft. length will be long enough,
while the bow paddle of 5 ft. will probably
suit the average man. Ladies,
boys, and girls will need shorter
lengths.</p>

<p>The shape of the paddle blades varies
somewhat, and while some prefer a
broad blade and others a narrow one,
it is well to pick out one of medium
size. Large blades are tiresome for
long trips, while the narrow blade
balances best in the hand, but affords
less resistance in the water. When
picking out a spruce paddle, see that
there is plenty of wood at the juncture
of the blade and shaft, for it is at this
point most paddles break. Spruce
being a comparatively soft wood, it
will fur badly, and the blades should be
fitted with copper tips to prevent splitting.
Maple paddles do not need this
protection, but most builders err in
making them too thick and heavy.
Pick out the lightest and thinnest
maple paddle that can be found, one
that is fashioned of straight-grained
wood, and test it for elasticity before
making the purchase. A couple of
coats of spar varnish will keep the paddles
in good shape, but as a varnished
surface is hard on the hands, most
veteran canoeists varnish the blades
and finish the shafts with oil. An extra
paddle will, of course, be carried on all
long trips.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The single-blade paddle is quite universally
used, but the double-blade
gives more spread for the lone paddler.
Although the double-blade was designed
for the “Rob Roy” type of canoe—a
one-man craft, decked both fore
and aft, the paddler sitting in a cockpit
in the center—it is sometimes used for
propelling the open Canadian canoe,
and when the canoeist travels alone,
the double-blade is a good choice, especially
on open waters where much wind
and high seas are likely to be encountered.
Spruce is the best material for
double paddles, and 10 ft. is the best
length. As all double-bladed paddles
are provided with a ferrule, or friction
joint, in the center, they may be unjointed
and each used as a pair of single
paddles. In case the open end of the
metal ferrule is objectionable, a wood
plug may be fitted to provide a palm
grip, similar to the grip of the single
paddle.</p>

<h3>Portages for Carrying the Canoe</h3>

<p>When the weight of the canoe does
not exceed 65 lb., it is easily carried by
placing the paddle blades over the center
thwart, the ends under the next
after thwart and lashing them securely
in place; then placing a sweater
or coat over the shoulder to form a<span class="pagenum" id="Page100">[100]</span>
pad on which to rest the paddles to
carry the canoe in an inverted position.
However, when long portages must be
undertaken the “neck yoke,” or the
pneumatic canoe yoke, may be used.
The neck yoke is fashioned from a
block of pine, or other soft wood, to fit
the curve of the shoulders, and the ends
fit in the grooves made in the gunwales;
or small pieces of wood may be screwed
to the under side of the gunwale to
serve the same purpose. The pneumatic
cushion, which fits around the
neck and is provided with straps to
secure the paddles in position, is well-liked
by some canoeists, but the wood
neck yoke fits so well that it is hard
to find a good substitute. A large and
heavy craft can be easily carried by
two men by turning the craft bottom
side up and resting the weight on the
back and shoulders. If the man at the
stern lets the gunwale rest on his
shoulders and his companion lower
the front thwart to rest against his
neck and shoulders, both may carry
a light pack of duffle and will have a
clear view of the trail ahead.</p>

suspended from the limb of a tree so
that it would be at the proper height

or get it tangled to its support. If
the strikes are made properly, the ball
will swing out and come back in a perfect

<p>A very true and artistic impression

as follows: Grease a piece of heavy

smoke the surface well by lighting a
small piece of camphor gum and holding
the paper over the flame. Place
the leaf on the smoked surface of the
paper and cover it with several thicknesses
of newspaper, then press the
leaf into the blackened surface. Remove
the leaf and lay it with the blackened

then cover again with the newspaper

the leaf will be transferred to the paper.</p>

<p>Care should be taken not to move the
leaf the least bit either in coating it
with the smoke or in transferring it to
the paper. Be careful not to use too
much oil. This process can be used
to stamp cloth for embroidery. A
candle can be used in place of the camphor

Handling the Paddle</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">T</span><span class="afterlargecap">he</span> knack of paddling a canoe as
the majority of amateurs paddle
is quickly learned, but to handle a paddle
as the expert woodsman and the
Indian wield it requires not a little
practice and experience. In the birch-bark
and canvas-covered craft, used by
the guides of Maine and Canada, there
are no seats, and the stern paddler
kneels with his back against the rear
thwart, while the bow paddler usually
kneels with his back against the second
thwart from the bow. However,
the builders of modern canoes furnish
a seat for each paddler, and while it is
more comfortable to use them, it is
better to take the kneeling position,
which brings the weight lower in the
canoe, as it is safer, and the paddler is
better able to control his craft. Again,
the use of the seat makes it impossible
for the paddler to put much of his body
into the stroke, and he propels the
craft largely through the muscles of
his arms and shoulders. But when
paddling from the knees they are
spread out to brace the body firmly,
and the back resting against the
thwart enables the paddler to use his
back and thigh muscles to drive his
craft ahead with much less exertion
and waste of energy than when sitting
erect. Of course, the kneeling position
is a source of discomfort at first, but
after a little practice it will be easy to
keep the position for several hours.</p>

<p>The stroke of the paddle is made with
the body motionless, one hand grasping
the shaft of the paddle and the other
holding it a short distance above the
blade. The paddle is now carried forward,
dipped into the water in front,
<a href="#Fig103">Fig. 1, A and B</a>, and carried downward
past the paddler’s body, <a href="#Fig103">Fig. 2, A and B</a>,
and the stroke is finished in the rear,
<a href="#Fig103">Fig. 3, A and B</a>. The paddle is recovered
by turning the wrist so that the
blade is turned edgewise as it is swung
through the air to begin the second
stroke. The swing of the paddle should
be smooth from the beginning to the
finish of the stroke, that is, free from
undue jerkiness, but the long and slow
sweep of the paddle is amateurish, pure
and simple. The canoemen of the North
woods do not use this stroke, but prefer
a shorter stroke, quick recovery of the
blade, and the “accent” of the stroke
is much the same as that the expert
axman uses when felling a tree. Therefore
one’s energy should be concentrated
upon the first part of the stroke,
easing up quickly as soon as the blade
is opposite the body, and finishing the
stroke smartly as it is carried backward.
The driving power of the paddle
diminishes rapidly as the blade is carried
backward, and if the full force of
the stroke is continued with a long
backward sweep, a way of most amateurs,
much energy is wasted, since it
adds nothing to the forward momentum<span class="pagenum" id="Page103">[103]</span>
of the canoe, but rather retards it, by
forcing down the stern, and also causes
the craft to drag more water after it.
For a short afternoon paddle almost
any kind of a stroke will suffice to drive
the canoe ahead, but upon long trips, or
when head winds and rough water are
encountered, the quick, short stroke
will save both time and muscle. The
long sweeping stroke of the summer
idler will probably
average about 26 to
30 strokes per minute,
while the North-woods
guide and Indian will
dip their blades
almost twice as
often, a fair cruising
average being
about 45 strokes
per minute. Short
strokes, with the
accent at the beginning
of the
stroke, will push
the canoe faster
and with less effort,
and the paddler
has better
control over his
craft.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The bow paddler
usually does
nothing more than
keep up a regular
stroke and watch for rocks and obstructions,
but if he is a good hand at the
paddle he can do much to steer the
canoe. For example, take the usual
bow stroke, made by dipping the paddle
quite close and ahead of the canoe.
The force of the stroke thus made
forces the bow in the opposite direction,
and the man in the stern will be
called upon to use more energy in steering.
In contrast to this faulty handling
of the paddle, the experienced bowman
will begin his stroke by dipping his paddle
well out from the bow and pulling it
toward him at a greater angle, which
keeps the canoe moving straight ahead
without swinging to one side, and the
energy of both paddlers is used in driving
the craft steadily ahead. When
paddling in tortuous and rocky streams
it is the bow paddler’s duty to watch
out for rocks and snags, and he should
always be prepared to “draw” the canoe
whenever it is necessary to clear an obstruction
or assist the stern paddler to
shoot the canoe around an abrupt bend.
To do this is simple enough, since the
bowman merely
reaches his paddle
out at arm’s
length over the
side and pulls the
bow in that direction,
while the
stern paddler simply
paddles
straight ahead.</p>

<p>The stern paddler
is the helmsman
of the canoe,
and while he can
keep his craft on a
straight course by
trailing his paddle at the end of each
stroke and using it like a rudder, it can
only be done when a long, slow stroke
is used. To save time and muscle, the
experienced stern paddler always finishes
his stroke with an outward push
and a turn of the wrist, which offsets the
swing of the bow and keeps the canoe
on a straight course with much less
effort than when trailing the paddle
astern. Paddling from the stern is
often considered difficult, but one soon
masters it by a little experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104]</span></p>

<h3>Paddling in Open and White Water</h3>

<div class="container w15emmax">

<img src="images/illo108.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">Dangerous for the Novice,
but Experts Win Races
in This Position</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>When traveling in the open waters
of large lakes where heavy winds and
seas are commonly encountered, paddling
should always be done on the
knees, and the canoeist’s own experience
and judgment must be called upon
to meet constantly changing conditions
of the wind and water. To cross a broad
stretch of wind-swept water where
whitecaps are running high, means a
long, hard fight, and the stern paddler
must be ever alert to ease the canoe
through breaking crests and shift his
balance whenever the necessity arises.
When paddling in rough water, many
canoeists make the mistake of driving
their craft too hard, consequently the
canoe will “pound” when it reaches the
trough of the sea, and much unnecessary
spray is sent flying aboard. Of
course, in rough water some spray is
certain to come over the rail, but if the
craft is well balanced by stowing the
camp duffle so that the canoe floats on
an even keel, it
will, with proper
handling, weather
a pretty stiff
gale.</p>

<p>When paddling
against a heavy
sea and wind,
the regular
stroke must be
altered and modified,
and the
man in the stern
may often balance
his craft by
holding his paddle
in the water
while a particular
high comber sweeps by. Short and
clean strokes are essential for handling
the canoe in a heavy sea, and while the
skillful canoeist can handle his craft in
the trough of the sea when the need
arises, it is hazardous for the novice
to attempt it. In heavy weather, it is
a good thing to keep one paddle in the
water while the other is in the air, hence
the experienced canoeist will—unconsciously
perhaps—alternate or “split”
strokes with his bowman.</p>

<p>To paddle, head on, into heavy seas
is slow and tiresome work, and most
canoeists find it easier to take the seas
on the quarter, and the stern paddler
must be ever on the lookout, nursing
his craft over the big ones and often
turning his bow into the largest combers.
To be sure, the canoe will plunge
more or less and yaw about, but the
stern paddler merely checks this side
spin, since he cannot prevent it entirely
and drive his craft onward at the same
time. When running before the wind,
it is only necessary to keep the canoe
balanced or “trimmed” to keep things
dry. Here the bow paddler has the
best of it; his sole duty is to keep paddling
steadily ahead, while the balancing
and handling of the canoe rests with
the man in the stern. This point is well
worth remembering, for to keep the
canoe right side up when shooting
rapids or when bucking heavy seas or
a lake, the bow paddler must stick to
his seat. He can, from his position in
the bow, quickly note rocks or other
obstructions and pass the word to his
partner, who from his point of advantage
can likewise better size up the
effect of a high wave upon the craft.
Probably more capsizes have resulted
through the bowman’s mistaken efforts
to balance the canoe by leaning to one
side, or attempting to dodge the spray
in rough-water paddling, than through
the inability of the stern paddler to
handle his craft.</p>

<p>Running a rapid stream in a canoe
is replete with excitement, but it is
likewise a dangerous bit of fun for the
inexperienced canoeist who has not fully
mastered the handling of his craft.
When running rapids where the water
is fairly deep, the use of the paddle is
the better way, providing both paddlers
kneel in the bottom of the canoe. Unknown
streams are naturally the most
dangerous, although the veteran canoeist
can “size” up the character of the
stream at the first glance, that is, the
trained eye of the woodsman will read
the bottom of the river by the indications
on the surface; depth of water,
strength of current, swirl caused by
submerged rocks, and many other details<span class="pagenum" id="Page105">[105]</span>
are evident to him. To the novice
these signs mean but little. If the current
flow is from three to four miles per
hour, rocks or submerged logs, 4 or 5
in. below the surface, will show very
little, but in a 10-mile or swifter current
obstructions 12 or even 18 in.
below the surface will throw up swirling
ripples, and in a very rocky stream
with much water flowing, rocks 3 or 4
ft. below will throw up waves of good
size. Again, waves are caused by swift
water striking the comparatively quiet
water of a deep pool and the canoeist
should be able to determine the difference
between them in order to know
what part of the stretch is dangerous
and that which may be run in safety.</p>

<p>The waves in a rapid stream are altogether
unlike the rolling waves of the
open lake, in that the crests follow one
another closely and the canoe cannot
rise, but plunges through the curling
crests. Rocks on the surface are easily
avoided, as they split the current, and
it is only necessary to steer the craft
to one side to pass them safely. The
one chief thing to do when shooting the
rapids is to keep the canoe on an even
keel and the bow into the current, and
when it is necessary to change channels,
the craft must be shot diagonally
across the fast water. To keep the
canoe under perfect control in white
water, it must be propelled faster than
the current flows, and the force of the
stream must not strike one side of the
bow with greater force than it exerts
on the other side. When a canoe swings
around in the current, the power of the
paddles will be unable to cope with the
more powerful current, which quickly
swings it broadside and one is struggling
in the water in the next instant.</p>

<p class="caption">The Double Blade Is Often Useful When Paddling
Single-Handed on a Broad Reach of
Wind-Swept Water</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>On a long canoe trip where much
rapid water must be run, a “setting
pole” should be reckoned a necessity.
The pole may be a stout sapling, 10 ft.
long, cut by the stream side, but an iron
shoe, or spike, about 3 in. long, with an
iron band or ferrule, should be carried
in the kit, the iron spike being simply
driven in the end of the green pole. The
pole may be used to good advantage
when running down shallow rapids, the
man in the bow kneeling and using his
paddle to help steer while his partner
stands in the stern and wields the pole.
When traveling up shallow and swift
streams, the setting pole is absolutely
necessary, and while at first it is an
awkward implement to handle, a little
practice will enable the canoeist to pole
his craft with very little more effort
than is required to paddle it. The use
of the pole necessitates a standing position,
but this is neither risky nor difficult
for any canoeist who understands
the knack of balancing a canoe, and
none but an experienced canoeist has
any business in swift, white water. The
setting pole is gripped with the left
hand near the top, with the right hand
held stationary about 2 ft. lower, and
as the canoe travels past the pole, firmly
planted on the river bottom, the poler
leans forward and makes use of his
weight and strength to give a quick
push. The pole is again shoved forward
as quickly as possible, that the
craft may lose as little headway as possible,
and a new grip secured for the
next push. After a little experience
with the pole, the canoeist will find it
an easy matter to swing his craft across
the current and avoid rocks and other
obstructions as easily as when paddling.
When contemplating a long
trip up a stream where the water is
heavy and the current swift, the use of
two poles will make the work easier.
Both persons should pole from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page106">[106]</span>
same side, the man in the bow doing
the steering while the stern man adds
his straight-ahead push to force the
canoe upstream.</p>

<h3>The Track Line</h3>

<p>The average wilderness stream of the
North has enough “tight” places which
judgment tells the traveler to avoid by
making a detour by land rather than
risk a capsize and a possible loss of the
outfit. To “tote” the outfit overland
means more or less hard work, and as
every canoeist will avoid portaging if
there is a fair chance of getting the
canoe through a bad stretch of water,
the tracking line will come in handy
very often. The usual ring in the bow
of the canoe is far too flimsy for hauling
the loaded craft, and sufficient length
of stout rope should be carried along
to pass through the painter eye, and
then carried aft and half-hitched to the
first and second thwarts. One man can
pull the canoe up a swift stream by
walking along the bank while his partner
takes up the opposite side and
steers the craft away from rocks by
using a stern line. With a heavily
loaded canoe in very swift and shallow
water, both men must often wade, and
a tump line rigged up as a breast or
shoulder strap will make it easier work
for the man at the bow line.</p>

<h3>Paddling a Canoe Single-Handed</h3>

<p>The open, or Canadian-model, canoe
is, of course, handled more easily and
with better speed with two paddlers
but there are occasions when the canoe
is used single-handed. When out for
a few hours’ paddle, the canoeist usually
balances the craft by sitting on the
bow seat—or kneels on the bottom with
his back against the bow-seat brace—and
using the stern for the bow. This
brings the paddler’s weight nearer the
center and keeps the canoe better balanced
than when paddling from the
stern with the bow high in the air.
However, when the canoe is loaded,
many canoeists stow their camp duffle
forward and paddle from the stern, the
weight of the outfit keeping the craft
on an even keel. This answers well
enough for smooth-water going, but
when the water is rough, or a stretch
of rapids is run single-handed, the stern
position is by no means a good one
since the craft is more difficult to control,
and much more strength is required
to drive it forward. The Indian
manner of paddling a canoe alone is the
only correct one, for he always sits
amidships—kneeling in the center—and
if a load is carried, it is placed in
front and back of him so that the craft
is balanced on an even keel. Consequently
the canoe draws less water and
can be paddled faster with the same
effort, while the paddler has the craft
under perfect control. But the experienced
line paddler does not kneel in the
center, he moves out until his body is
close to the gunwale. This makes the
craft heel at a decided angle, it is true,
but this position makes for better speed
because it enables the paddle to be held
almost vertical, and the more nearly
perpendicular the paddle is swung the
more efficient will be the stroke.</p>

<p>In using the double blade, the paddler
dips first on one side, then on the
other, and to make the blades travel
through the air with the least resistance,
it is customary to set them at
right angles to each other. The motion
is really a push and pull, the shaft of
the paddle being rotated in the hands
so that the blade will enter the water
with the full breadth facing the canoeist.
Rubber cups, to catch the drip as
the paddle rises in the air when making<span class="pagenum" id="Page107">[107]</span>
the stroke, are sometimes used by
novices, but these are unnecessary if the
paddles are set at right angles, and the
paddler will bend his wrist a trifle to
throw the drip ahead and to one side.
At the beginning, the novice will very
likely throw a little water in the canoe,
but a little practice will soon master the
knack.</p>

<h3>Care and Repair of the Canoe</h3>

<p>The canvas-covered cedar canoe will
stand a vast amount of hard service,
but it should not be dragged over the
ground or over the boarding of the landing
float, neither should it be so placed
that any strain will come amidships
while the ends are well supported.
When storing for the winter, keep it
under cover, resting bottom side down
on a floor, or turn it bottom side up and
support it with boxes, or other standards,
at the center as well as at the ends.
While unused at the camp, turn it bottom
side up on the bank. Birch bark
must be kept out of the sun, and the
paint of canvas-covered canoes will last
longer if kept in the shade. When the
paint becomes rough, sandpaper it
down smooth, and give it a couple of
coats of canoe paint. When the paint
is worn off and exposes the canvas, give
the bare cloth a couple of coats of shellac
before painting.</p>

<div class="container w40emmax">

<img src="images/illo111a.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">Paddling should be Done on the Knees When Traveling
Where High Winds and Seas are Encountered</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>A repair kit should be taken along
on all long trips, consisting of a small
can of white lead, a can of orange shellac,
and a sheet of oiled silk. For small
cuts in the canvas, a coat or two of shellac
will suffice, but for bad gashes, cut
off the loose threads of canvas and rub
on a little white lead under the raised
portion near the hole and on the surface,
cut a patch of the oiled silk to
cover it, and paste it in position. When
the lead is dry, give it a couple of coats
of shellac. For making quick repairs,
a roll of electrician’s tape will come in
handy. The birch canoe is quickly
repaired in the same manner as suggested
for the canvas-covered craft, and
as the shellac is waterproof and dries
quickly, all ordinary repairs may be
made by the stream side with but little
loss of time.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Oiling Tool for Clocks</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Jewelers use a little tool for oiling
clocks and watches that could be used
profitably by others for the same and
similar work. It consists of a steel
wire, bluntly pointed on the end and
set into a wood handle. Very often
the only thing that is the matter with
a clock which does not keep good time,
is that it is dirty and dry. If this is
the case, any person handy with tools
can fix it at practically no cost. Remove
the works, which are usually held
with four screws, from the case, immerse
them in kerosene and allow them
to stand for a few minutes, then remove
and drain. This will clean out
the dirt.</p>

<p class="caption">The Tool will Pick Up a Drop of Oil and Deposit It
Where Wanted</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The oiling tool is dipped in light oil
and a drop applied to each bearing. Replace
the works in the case and the job
is finished. A reliable jeweler will
charge very little for this work, but the
more crafty ones may ask a good price
for this “mysterious” process. If the
works are not dirty, apply the oil with
the tool. Anyone who has tried to oil
a clock with an ordinary spout oilcan
knows the futility of the attempt. The
object of the tool is to pick up and
carry a drop of oil and deposit it where
wanted. A can, a feather, or a match
will do, but any one of them is apt to
carry dirt, flood the dry part, or smear
up nonmoving parts.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<h3>The Choice of a Tent</h3>

<p>There are tents and tents, but for
average outings in what may be considered
a permanent camp, the regulation
wall, or army, tent is generally
used to make a comfortable shelter.
It is a splendid utility tent, with
generous floor space and plenty of
headroom. For the permanent
camp, the wall tent is
often provided with a fly,
which may be set up as an
extra covering for the roof,
or extended over the front
to make a kind of porch.
An extension may also be
purchased to serve the same
purpose. The 7 by 9-ft.
wall tent will shelter two
persons comfortably, but
when the camp is seldom
moved, the 9 by 12-ft. size,
with a 3¹⁄₂-ft. wall, will afford
more room. The regulation<span class="pagenum" id="Page110">[110]</span>
8-oz. duck is heavy enough, or
the same tent may be obtained in tan
or dark green khaki, if preferred. In
any case the tent should have a sod
cloth, from 6 to 12 in. wide, extending
around the bottom and sewed to the
tent. An extra piece of canvas or floor
cloth is desirable, but this as well as
the fly are extras, and while convenient,
are by no means necessary. The wall
tent may be erected with the regular
poles, or it may be ordered with tapes
along the ridge and erected by suspending
between two trees. The old
hand at the camping game rarely uses
the shop poles supplied with most
tents, but prefers to cut them at the
camping site and rig them up on the
outside, one slender pole fastened with
tapes along the ridge and supported
at either end in the crotch formed by
setting up two poles, tripod or shear-fashion.</p>

<p>The “Baker” style is a popular tent,
giving a large sleeping capacity, yet
folding compactly. The 7 by 7-ft. size,
with a 2-ft. wall, makes a good comfortable
home for two, and will shelter
three, or even four, if required. The
entire front may be opened to the fire
by extending it to form an awning, or
it may be thrown back over the ridge
to form an open-front lean-to shelter.</p>

<p>The “Dan Beard,” or camp-fire, tent
is a modification of the Baker style,
having a slightly steeper pitch, with a
smaller front opening. The dimensions
are practically the same as the Baker,
and it may be pitched by suspending
between two trees, by outside poles, or
the regular poles may be used.</p>

<p>For traveling light by canoe or pack,
a somewhat lighter and less bulky form
of tent than the above styles may be
chosen, and the woodsman is likely to
select the forester’s or ranger types.
The ranger is a half tent with a 2-ft.
wall and the entire front is open; in
fact, this is the same as the Baker tent
without the flap. If desired, two half
ranger tents with tapes may be purchased
and fastened together to form
an A, or wedge, tent. This makes a
good tent for two on a hike, as each
man carries his own half, and is assured
a good shelter in case one becomes
separated from his companion,
and a tight shelter when the two make
camp together.</p>

<p>The forester’s tent is another good
one, giving good floor space and folding
up very compactly, a 9 by 9-ft. tent
weighing about 5¹⁄₂ lb. when made of
standard-weight fabric. It may be had
either with or without hood, and is
quickly erected by using three small
saplings, one along the ridge, running
from peak to ground, and one on each
side of the opening, to form a crotch
to support the ridge pole, shear-fashion.
These tents are not provided with
sod or floor cloths, although these may
be ordered as extras if wanted.</p>

<p>The canoe or “protean” tents are
good styles for the camper who travels
light and is often on the move. The
canoe tent has a circular front, while
the protean style is made with a square
front, and the wall is attached to the
back and along the two sides. Both
tents are quickly set up, either with a
single inside pole or with two poles
set shear-fashion on the outside. A
9 by 9-ft. canoe or protean tent with a
3-ft. wall makes a comfortable home in
the open.</p>

<p>Whatever style of tent is chosen, it
is well to pay a fair price and obtain
a good quality of material and workmanship.
The cheaper tents are made
of heavier material to render them
waterproof, while the better grades are
fashioned from light-weight fabric of
close weave and treated with a waterproofing
process. Many of the cheaper
tents will give fair service, but the
workmanship is often poor, the grommets
are apt to pull out, and the seams
rip after a little hard use. All tents
should be waterproofed, and each provided
with a bag in which to pack it.
An ordinary tent may be waterproofed
in the following manner: Dissolve ¹⁄₂
lb. of ordinary powdered alum in 4 gal.
of hot rain water, and in a separate
bucket dissolve ¹⁄₂ lb. of acetate of lead—sugar
of lead—in 4 gal. of hot rain
water. The acetate of lead is poisonous
if taken internally. When thoroughly
dissolved, let the solution<span class="pagenum" id="Page111">[111]</span>
stand until clear, then pour
the alum solution into a tub
and add the lead solution.
Let the solution stand for
an hour or two, then pour
off the clear water and thoroughly
soak the fabric in
the waterproofing mixture
by rubbing and working the
material with the hands.
Hang the cloth up without
wringing it out.</p>

<h3>How to Pitch a Tent</h3>

<p>It is, of course, possible
to pitch a tent almost anywhere,
but for the sake of
comfort, it is well to select
a site with natural drainage.
Many campers dig a shallow
trench around the tent to
prevent water from running
in during a heavy rain. This
is a good idea for the permanent
camp, but is not
often necessary if the soil is
sandy or porous, or where
a sod cloth is used.</p>

<p>It is rarely necessary to
carry the regular poles to
the camping ground, and
they may be omitted excepting
when en route to a treeless
region. The wall and
other large tents may be
pitched in several ways. In
some places the woodsman
cuts a straight ridge pole,
about 3 ft. longer than the
tent, and two crotched uprights,
1 ft. or more longer
than the height of the tent.
The ridge pole is passed
through the opening in the
peak of the tent, or fastened
to the outside of the ridge
with tapes sewed to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span>
cloth. The two upright stakes are
then firmly planted in the ground, one
at the back and the other in front, and
the ridge pole is lifted and dropped
into these crotched supports. Set up
the four corner guys first to get the
tent in shape, then peg down the side
guys and slide them taut so that all
of them will exert an even pull on the
tent. Another good method for setting
up the side guys is to drive four
crotched stakes, each about 4 ft. long,
somewhere near 3 ft. from each corner
of the tent, and drop a fairly heavy
pole in the rest so formed, then fasten
the guy ropes to this pole. When a
sod cloth is provided it is turned under
on the inside, the floor cloth is spread
over it and the camp duffel distributed
along the walls of the tent, to hold it
down and prevent insects and rain
from entering.</p>

<p>To overcome the disadvantage of
placing the poles in the center of the
entrance, the uprights may be formed
by lashing two poles together near the
top to make a crotch and spreading
the bottoms to form a pair of shears.
Poles may be dispensed with entirely,
providing the tent is ordered with
tapes for attaching a rope to suspend
the ridge of the tent between two
trees. In a wooded country this manner
of setting a tent is generally
preferred.</p>

<p>Where a wall tent is used in a more
permanent camp, it is a good plan to
order a fly, a couple of sizes larger than
the tent. This should be set up by
using separate poles and rigged some
6 or 8 in. higher than the ridge of the
tent, thus affording an air space to
temper the heat of the sun and also
serving to keep things dry during long,
heavy rains.</p>

<h3>The Camping Kit</h3>

<p>The camping kit, including the few
handy articles needed in the woods, as
well as the bedding and cooking outfit,
may be either elaborate or simple,
according to the personal experience
and ideas of the camper. In making
up a list, it is a good plan to remember
that only comparatively few articles
are really essential for a comfortable
vacation in the wilderness. A comfortable
bed must be reckoned one of the
chief essentials, and one may choose
the de-luxe couch—the air mattress or
sleeping pocket—use the ordinary
sleeping bag, or court slumber on one
of the several other styles of camp
beds. The fold-over combination bed,
the stretcher bed, or a common bag
made of ticking, 6¹⁄₂ ft. long by 2 ft.
wide, which is stuffed with browse or
leaves, will suffice for the average person.
Folding camp cots, chairs, tables,
and other so-called camp furniture,
have their places in the large, fixed
camps, but the woodsman can manage
to live comfortably without them. A
good pair of warm blankets should be
included for each person, providing
the sleeping bag is not taken along.
The regulation army blankets are a
good choice and reasonable in price,
or the blankets used at home may be
pressed into service.</p>

<p>A good ax is the woodsman’s everyday
companion, and a good-weight tool,
weighing 3 or 4 lb., and a smaller one
of 1¹⁄₂ lb. should be carried. When
going light, the belt ax will suffice.</p>

<p>The oil lantern is only suited for the
fixed camp, since the fuel is difficult
to transport unless it is placed in
screw-top cans. The “Stonbridge” and
other folding candle lanterns are the
most convenient for the woods and
give sufficient light for camp life.</p>

<p>The aluminum cooking outfits are
light in weight, nest compactly, and
will stand many years of hard usage,
but like other good things, they are
somewhat expensive. A good substitute,
at half the price, may be obtained
in tin and steel, having the good feature
of nesting within each other, but,
of course, not being quite so light nor so
attractive in appearance as the higher-priced
outfits. Both the aluminum and
steel outfits are put up in canvas carrying
bags, and an outfit for two includes
a large and a small cooking pot
coffee pot; frying pan with folding or
detachable handle; two plates; cups
knives; forks, and spoons. Outfits may
be bought for any number of persons
and almost all sporting-goods stores
carry them. The two-man outfit in
heavy aluminum will cost $9 or $10,
while the same outfit duplicated in steel
is priced at $3.35.</p>

<h3>The Camper’s Outfit</h3>

<p>The personal outfit should include
only the most useful articles, and each
member of the party should be provided
with a dunnage bag of canvas to
hold bedding and clothing, and a
smaller, or “ditty,” bag for keeping together
the toilet and other personal belongings
which most everyone finds
necessary for everyday comfort. A
mending kit, containing a few yards of
silk, linen, and twist; a length of mending
cotton; buttons; a few needles and
pins, both safety and the common
kinds, should not be overlooked. The
veteran usually stows away a bit of
wire; a length of strong twine; a few
nails and tacks; rivets, etc., for emergency
use, and it is surprising to the
novice how handy these several odds
and ends are found while in camp. A
compact tin box will form a convenient
place to keep them and will take up
little room in the dunnage bag. A medicine
case and a first-aid outfit are well
worth packing; the smallest cases containing
a few of the common remedies
will fully meet the camper’s needs.</p>

<p>When carrying food by canoe or
pack basket, the canoe duffel and provision
bags are a great convenience,
enabling the outer to carry different
foodstuffs in a compact and sanitary
manner. Food bags may be had in
different sizes, and friction-top tins
may be purchased to fit them; and one
or more of these liquid-proof containers
are desirable for transporting lard,
butter, pork, ham, and other greasy
necessities. The food bags slip into the
larger duffel bags, making a very compact
bundle for stowing away in a
canoe or pack harness.</p>

<h3>Carrying List for the Camp Outfit</h3>

<p>For permanent camps, take the wall
tent with fly, although the Baker or
camp-fire styles are also good. When
traveling light by canoe, the canoe or
protean tents are recommended. When
going very light by pack, use the forester’s
or ranger’s tent. Sod and floor
cloths and mosquito netting are optional.</p>

<p>The cooking kit may be of aluminum
or steel, all nesting within the largest
pot. Include a folding baker, or reflector,
with bread board in a canvas
bag, a wood salt box, and a water-tight
can for matches.</p>

<p>Furniture for the permanent camp
consists of a full-sized ax, double-blade
or tomahawk style with straight handle,
in a protecting case, whetstone and
file for keeping the ax in shape. A
shovel and saw will be needed when a
cabin is built. A canteen may be included,
but is not required on most
trips. A folding candle lantern is the
best for the average trip, but an oil,
or acetylene, lantern may be used in a
fixed camp. Cots, folding chairs,
tables, hangers, etc., are only useful in
fixed camps.</p>

<p>A pack basket with a waterproof-canvas
lid and cover, having straps to
go over the shoulders, is a general favorite
with woodsmen and guides. Canvas
packs or dunnage bags may be used
if preferred. There are two sizes of
food bags, one holding 5 lb. and another
of 10-lb. capacity, with draw-strings
at the top, and these are the
best for carrying provisions.</p>

<p>Pack harness, with a tumpline to go
across the forehead, is needed when
the outfit must be carried on portages,
etc. This may be omitted when pack
baskets are used. Packing cases of
fiber may be used for shipping the outfit
to the camping ground, but ordinary
trunks, or wood boxes, will answer
as well.</p>

<h3>The Personal Outfit</h3>

<p>An old ordinary suit that is not worn
too thin is sufficient. Corduroy is too
heavy for the summer and too cold for
winter, and canvas is too stiff and noisy
for the woods. Cotton khaki is excellent
for the summer, and all-wool
khaki, or mackinaw, coat and trousers
are comfortable for winter. Wool is
the best material for undergarments<span class="pagenum" id="Page115">[115]</span>
in all seasons. Two sets of garments
will be sufficient, as the washing is
done at night. Be sure to have the garments
large enough to allow for shrinkage.
Light-weight cashmere is the best
material for socks during summer, and
heavier weight for the winter. Three
pairs of ordinary-weight and one pair
of heavy-weight will be sufficient. A
medium-weight gray-flannel overshirt,
with breast pockets having button
flaps, is the woodsman’s choice. On
short and light trips one shirt will do.
A light-weight, all-wool gray or brown,
sweater is a good thing to carry along,
it is easily wetted through and a famous
brier catcher, yet most woodsmen
carry one.</p>

<p>The regulation army poncho is more
suited to the woods than a rubber coat
or oilskins. The larger-size poncho is
more bulky to pack, but may be used
as a shelter by rigging it up with poles,
lean-to fashion. A poncho makes a
good ground blanket also.</p>

<p>A medium wide-brimmed hat, in
gray or brown, is better than a cap.
A gray, or brown, silk handkerchief
should be included to wear around the
neck to protect it from the sun and cold.
Only few novices will carry one, but
not so with the regular woodsman,
The moccasin is the only suitable footwear
for the woods. The “puckaway,”
with extra sole, is known to most
woodsmen. A pair of larrigans—ankle-high
moccasins with single sole—are
suitable to wear about the camp.</p>

<p>Each member of the party carries his
own knapsack, or ditty bag, in which
such things as brush and comb, toothbrush,
razor, towel, medicines, stationery,
etc., are kept. The extra clothing
is carried in its own canvas bag.</p>

<p>Each member of the party carries a
pair of woolen blankets. Army blankets
in tan color are serviceable and inexpensive.</p>

<p>A good, tempered knife should be
worn at the belt, preferably one without
a hilt and having a blade 5 or 6 in.
long.</p>

<p>A small leather pouch containing a
few common remedies, such as quinine,
laxative, etc.; and a small first-aid outfit
should be included in each camper’s
personal pack. Also a small leather
pouch containing an assortment of
needles, darning cotton, buttons, and a
length of heavy silk twist is a handy
companion.</p>

<p>A few sheets of paper and as many
envelopes, a notebook, pencil, and a few
postal cards, are usually carried, together
with an almanac page of the
months covering the intended trip.</p>

<p>The compass is by far the most useful
instrument in the woods, but any
reliable and inexpensive watch may be
carried.</p>

<p>Many woodsmen carry a small
hatchet at the belt, and on trips when
but the few necessities are carried the
belt ax takes the place of the heavier-weight
tool. The tomahawk style
gives two cutting edges and is therefore
the best tool to carry. A leather
or other covering case is needed to protect
the blades.</p>

<p>A small tin box containing an assortment
of rivets; tacks; a bit of
string; brass wire; a few nails; a
couple of small files; a tool holder with
tools; a sheet of sandpaper; a bit of
emery cloth, and any other small articles
which the sportsman fancies will
come in handy, may be carried. It is
surprising how often this “what not”
is resorted to while in the woods.</p>

<p>The odds and ends of personal belongings,
as a jackknife; pipe and tobacco;
map of the region visited;
length of fishing line and hook; a few
loose matches; match box; purse; notebook
and pencil; handkerchief, etc.,
are, of course, carried in the pocket of
the coat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A Simple Self-Contained Motor</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>To say that the subject of this article
is the simplest motor in the world is
not to overestimate it, for the apparatus
is not only a
motor reduced to
its essential elements,
but combines within itself
its own
source of electric
power, all without
the use of a
single piece of
wire. The experiment
is very interesting
and
instructive and
will well repay
a careful construction
along
the lines indicated,
even though
not in strict accordance
with
the dimensions
given.</p>

<p>The first step
is to procure a permanent magnet,
about ³⁄₈ in. in diameter and 6 in. long.
If such a magnet cannot be conveniently
secured, a piece of tool steel with
flat ends should be hardened by heating
it to a dull red and plunging it in water,
and then strongly magnetized. This
may be readily accomplished by slipping
a coil of insulated wire over it
through which the current from a storage
battery or set of primary cells is
passed. If these are not at hand, almost
any electrical supply store will magnetize
the steel.</p>

<div class="container w35emmax">

<div class="split5050">

<div class="left5050">

<img src="images/illo120a.jpg" alt="Motor (sketch)">

</div><!--left5050-->

<div class="right5050">

<img src="images/illo120b.jpg" alt="Motor (details and dimensions)">

</div><!--right5050-->

<p class="thinline allclear">&#160;</p>

</div><!--split5050-->

</div><!--container-->

<p>A square base block with neatly beveled
corners is now in order, which is
trimmed up squarely and a hole bored
centrally through it to receive the lower
end of the magnet. Procure a neat
spool and make a hole in it large enough
to pass over the magnet. Glue the
spool to the base after locating it in
the exact center.</p>

<p>The outer and larger cylinder is of
copper, or of brass, copperplated on
the inside. It is cup-shaped, with a
hole in the bottom just large enough to
permit the magnet to be pushed
through with a close fit, to make a good
electrical contact. The magnet may be
held in place by having it closely fit the
spool and the copper cylinder, and by
soldering the heads of a couple of small
tacks, or nails, to its under side and
driving them into the spool. Coat the
magnet with pitch, or paraffin, from the
top down, and around its connection
with the bottom of the cylinder. The
small thimble shown at the top should
be of brass or copper, and while one
can be easily formed of sheet metal and
soldered, it is not improbable that one
could be made in seamless form from
small article of commerce. In the
exact center of the under side of the
top of this thimble, make a good mark
with a prickpunch, after which a small
steel thumb tack should be filed to a
fine needle point and placed, point up,
exactly central on the upper end of the
magnet, to which it is held with a little
wax. The smaller cylinder is simply a
piece of sheet zinc bent into a true
cylinder of such
a size that it may
be sprung over
the lower end of
the thimble. This
done, it is only
necessary to slip
the zinc over the
end of the magnet
until the
thimble rests on
the thumb tack,
and then pour
some dilute muriatic
or sulphuric
acid into the
outer cylinder
after which the
thimble and attached
zinc will
begin to rotate.
The required
strength of the acid and the resulting
speed will depend upon the nicety of
suspension and the trueness of the rotating
zinc cylinder. The zinc will
have to be changed, but the copper
undergoes no deterioration.</p>

<span class="partname">PART II—Cooking in the Woods</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">C</span><span class="afterlargecap">ooking</span> in the woods requires
more of a knack than equipment,
and while a camp stove is well enough
in a permanent camp, its weight and
bulk makes this article of camp furniture
unsuited for transportation by
canoe. Patent cooking grates are less
bulky, but the woodsman can learn to
do without them very nicely. However,
the important item which few
woodsmen care to do without is the
folding baker, or reflector. The baker is
folded flat and carried in a canvas case,
including baking pan and a kneading
board. The largest size, with an 18-in.
square pan, weighs about 5 lb., and the
smallest, with an 8 by 12-in. pan in
aluminum, only 2 lb. In use, the reflector
is placed with the open side close
to the fire, and cooking is accomplished
evenly and well in any kind of weather.
Bread, fish, game, or meat are easily
and perfectly cooked, and the smaller
size is amply large for a party of two
or three.</p>

<div class="container w50emmax">

<img src="images/illo121.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">A Cooking Range Fashioned from
Two Green Logs Laid in a V-Shape with
a Few Stones Built Up at the Wide End over
Which a Fire is Made of Hard-Wood Sticks</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The camp fire is one of the charms
of the open, and if it is built right and
of the best kind of wood, cooking may
be done over it as well as over a forest
range. Many woodsmen prefer to
build a second and smaller fire for cooking,
and although I have never found
this necessary, excepting in large
camps where a considerable quantity
of food must be prepared, the camper
can suit himself, for experimenting is,
after all, a large part of the fun of living
in and off the woods.</p>

<p>A satisfactory outdoor cooking range
may be fashioned by roughly smoothing
the top and bottom sides of two
green logs, and placing them about 6
in. apart at one end and about 2 ft.
apart at the opposite end. At the wide
end a few stones are built up, and
across these, hickory, ash, and other
sticks of hard wood are placed. The
reflector is placed close to the coals at
this end, and the fire is built between
the logs, the broiling and frying being
done at the narrow-end opening.
Woods that burn slowly when green
should be used for backlogs and end
logs; chestnut, red oak, butternut, red
maple, and persimmon being best
adapted for this purpose.</p>

<p>The hard woods are best for cooking
and heating, since they burn more
slowly, and give out considerable heat<span class="pagenum" id="Page118">[118]</span>
and burn down to a body of glowing
coals. Soft woods are quick to catch
fire, burn rapidly, and make a hot fire,
but burn down to dead ashes. Hickory
is by far the best firewood of the
North, in that it makes a hot fire, is
long-burning, and forms a large body
of coals that gives an even and intense
heat for a considerable length of time.
Next to hickory comes chestnut; the
basket oaks, ironwood, dogwood, and
ash are the woodsman’s favorites.
Among the woods that are easy to split
are the red oak, basket oak, white oak,
ash, and white birch. Some few woods
split more easily when green than after
seasoning, and among them are hickory,
dogwood, beech, sugar maple,
birch, and elm. The most stubborn
woods to split are the elder, blue ash,
cherry, sour gum, hemlock, sweet gum,
and sycamore. Of the softer woods,
the birches make the best fuel; black
birch in particular makes a fine camp
fire, and it is one of the few woods that
burns well when green. The dry bark
of the hemlock makes a quick and hot
fire, and white birch takes fire quickly
even though moist. Driftwood is good
to start a fire with, and dry pine knots—the
limb stubs of a dead pine tree—are
famous kindlers. Green wood will,
of course, burn better in winter when
the sap is dormant, and trees found on
high ground make better fuel than
those growing in moist bottom lands.
Hard woods are more plentiful on high
ground, while the softer woods are
found in abundance along the margins
of streams.</p>

<div class="container w50emmax">

<img src="images/illo122.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">A Green Pole Placed in
a Forked Stick Provides
a Pot Hanger for a
Noonday Meal</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>For cooking the noonday meal a
small fire will suffice to boil the pot
and furnish the heat sufficient to make
a fry. Simply drive a forked stick in
the ground and lay a green stick in the
fork with the opposite end on the
ground with a rock laid on it to keep
it down, and hang the pot on the projecting
stub left for this purpose. A
long stick with projecting stubs,
planted in the ground to slant over
the fire at an angle, will serve as well.
Let the pot hang about 2 ft. from the
ground, collect an armful of dry twigs
and plenty of larger kindling sticks.
Now shave three or four of the larger
sticks and leave the shavings on the
ends, stand them up beneath the pot,
tripod fashion, and place the smaller
sticks around them to build a miniature
wigwam. While the pot is boiling get
a couple of bed chunks, or andirons,
4 or 5 in. in diameter, set and level
these on each side of the fire, and put
the frying pan on them. When the
pot has boiled there will be a nice bed
of coals for frying that will not smoke
the meal.</p>

<p>When the woodsman makes “one-night
stands,” he will invariably build
the fire and start the kettle boiling
while he or a companion stakes the
tent, and as soon as the meal is prepared,
a pot of water is started boiling
for dish washing.</p>

<p>For roasting and baking with the reflector,
a rather high fire is needed and
a few sticks, a yard or more long, resting
upright against a backlog or rock,
will throw the heat forward. When
glowing coals are wanted one can take
them from the camp fire, or split uniform
billets of green, or dead, wood
about 2 in. thick and pile them in the
form of a hollow square, or crib. The
fire is built in the center of the crib
and more parallel sticks are laid on
top until it is a foot or more higher.
The crib will act as a chimney, and
a roaring fire will result, which upon
burning down will give a glowing mass
of coals.</p>

<p>Camp cookery implies the preparation
of the more simple and nutritious
foods, and in making up a list it is well
to include only the more staple foodstuffs,
which are known to have these
qualities. Personal ideas are certain to
differ greatly, but the following list
may be depended upon and will serve
as a guide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span></p>

<h3>Provision List</h3>

<p>This list of material will be sufficient
for two persons on an outing of two
weeks. Carry in a stout canvas food
bag 12 lb. of common wheat flour. The
self-raising kind is good, but the common
flour is better. It is well to bring
a little yellow, or white, corn meal,
about 6 lb., to be served as a johnny
cake, hot, cold, or fried mush. It is
fine for rolling a fish in for frying.
Rice is very nutritious, easily digested,
and easy to cook. It is good when
boiled with raisins. When cold, it can
be fried in slices. About 3 lb. will be
sufficient. Oatmeal is less sustaining
than rice, but it is good for porridge,
or sliced when cold and fried. Take
along about 3 lb. About 2 lb. of the
self-raising buckwheat flour should be
taken along, as it is the favorite for
flapjacks or griddle cakes. Beans are
very nutritious, and about 2 lb. of the
common baking kind will be required,
to boil or bake with the salt pork. For
soups, take 2 lb. of split peas. They
can also be served as a vegetable. Salt
pork is a stand-by, and 5 lb. of it is
provided and carried in friction-top
tins or a grease-proof bag. It should be
parboiled before adding to the beans or
when fried like bacon. The regulation
meat of the wilderness is bacon, and
5 lb. of it is carried in a tin or bag.
Carry along 3 lb. of lard in a tin or
bag, for bread-making and frying.
About 3 lb. of butter is carried in a
friction-top tin. For making rice puddings,
take along 1 lb. of raisins. About
1 lb. of shredded codfish is good for
making fish balls. Other small articles,
such as ¹⁄₂ lb. of tea; 1 lb. of coffee;
3 lb. of granulated sugar; 1 pt. of
molasses; 1 pt. of vinegar; 4 cans of
condensed milk; 1 can of milk powder,
a good substitute for fresh milk; 1 can
egg powder, good for making omelets
or can be scrambled; 1 lb. salt; 2 oz.
pepper; 1 package each of evaporated
potatoes, onions, and fruits, and 3
packages of assorted soup tablets.</p>

<p>This list is by no means complete,
but it will suffice for the average person
on the average trip, since the occasional
addition of a fish or game will
help to replenish the stores. When
going very light by pack, only the most
compact and nutritious foods should be
selected, while on short, easy trips the
addition of canned goods will supply a
greater variety.</p>

<h3>Woodcraft</h3>

<div class="container w40emmax">

<img src="images/illo123.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">A Limb Supported at an Angle over the Fire Is
Another Means of Hanging the Pot</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>While shooting and fishing and
camping out are chapters in the book
of woodcraft, the word is generally defined
to mean the knack of using the
compass, the map, and in making use
of the natural signs of the woods when
traveling in the wilderness. If the
camper keeps to the beaten paths and
does not stray far from the frequently
used waterways, he needs no compass,
and sufficient knowledge of the ways
of the woods may be acquired from
the previous articles, but if the outer
ventures into an unknown region the
value of more intimate knowledge increases
as the distance to civilization
lengthens, because it will enable him
to keep traveling in the desired direction
and prevent the “insane desire to
circle,” should one discover he has lost
the trail.</p>

<h3>The Emergency “Snack” and Kit</h3>

<p>The woodsman well knows that it is
an easy matter to stray farther from
camp than he intended to when starting
out, and that it is a common enough
occurrence to lose one’s bearings and
become temporarily lost. To prepare
for this possible emergency and spend
a comfortable night away from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page120">[120]</span>
camp, he carries in his pocket a little
packet of useful articles and stows
away a tiny package containing a
small amount of nutritious food. When
leaving camp for
a day’s hunting
and fishing, the
usual lunch is,
of course, included,
but in addition
to this, the
woodsman
should carry a
couple of soup
tablets, a piece
of summer sausage,
and some tea. Wrap this in oiled
silk, and pack it in a flat tin box. It
will take up very little room in the
pocket.</p>

<p>The emergency kit is merely a small
leather pouch containing a short fishing
line; a few fishing hooks; 1 ft. of
surgeon’s adhesive plaster; needle and
thread; a few safety pins, and a small
coil of copper or brass wire. These
articles, with the gun and a few spare
cartridges, or rod; a belt knife; match
safe; compass; map; a little money,
pipe, and tobacco, make up the personal
outfit without which few woodsmen
care to venture far from camp. In addition
to the above, I carry a double-edge,
light-weight ax, or tomahawk, in
a leather sheath at the belt and a tin
cup strung to the back of the belt,
where it is out of the way and unnoticed
until wanted.</p>

<h3>The Compass</h3>

<p>A small pocket compass affixed to a
leather thong should be carried in the
breast pocket and fastened to a button
of the shirt. An instrument costing $1
will be accurate enough for all purposes.
Many of the woodsmen as well
as the Indians do not use a compass,
but even the expert woodsman gets
lost sometimes, and it may happen that
the sun is obscured by clouds, thus
making it more difficult to read the
natural signs of the wilderness. The
compass is of little value if a person
does not know how to use it. It will
not tell in what direction to go, but
when the needle is allowed to swing
freely on its pivot the blue end always
points to the magnetic north. The
true north lies a degree or more to
either side. In the West, for instance,
the needle will be attracted a trifle to
the east, while on the Atlantic coast it
will swing a trifle to the west of the
true north. This magnetic variation
need not be taken into account by the
woodsman, who may consider it to
point to the true north, for absolute
accuracy is not required for this purpose.
However, I would advise the
sportsman to take the precaution of
scratching on the back of the case these
letters, B = N, meaning blue equals
north. If this is done, the novice will
be certain to remember and read the
compass right no matter how confused
he may become on finding that he has
lost his way. The watch may be used
as a compass on a clear day by pointing
the hour hand to the sun, when the
point halfway between the hour hand
and 12 will be due south.</p>

<div class="container w25emmax">

<img src="images/illo124a.jpg" alt="Using a watch for a compass">

</div><!--container-->

<p>The compass needle is attracted to
iron and steel, therefore keep it away
from the gun, hatchet, knife, and other
metal articles.
Hold the compass
level and
press the stop, if
it has one, so
that the needle
may swing free.
Note some landmark,
as a prominent
tree, high
cliff,
or other
conspicuous object
lying in the
direction of travel,
and go directly
to this object.
Consult the compass frequently when
making a detour, or when the landmark
passes out of sight. When this mark
is reached, select another farther on
and continue the travel, always picking
out new marks along the line indicated
by the compass. When making
camp, consult a map, study it, and so
gain a good general idea of the surrounding
country; and when leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page121">[121]</span>
camp, take the bearings from the
compass. By so doing a person will
know in what direction he is traveling,
and when the course is changed, keep
the general direction in mind. When
climbing a hill or making detours, take
a mental note of the change in direction
and the bearings will not be lost.</p>

<h3>Maps</h3>

<p>The maps of the U. S. Geological
Survey are drawn to a scale of 2 in. to
the mile and cost 5 cents each. On
the back of each map are printed the
symbols showing the character of the
land, the contours, roads, and all important
rivers and lakes in the district.
For convenience, the map should be
pasted on a backing of cotton cloth
and then cut up into handy sections.
Number the sections from left to right
and paste a key to the pieces on the
back of one of them.</p>

<h3>Natural Signs</h3>

<p>When traveling through underbrush
the woodsman cannot see far ahead,
and so lays a true course by noting the
position of the sun. For example, here
in the northern hemisphere the sun
rises just south of east and sets somewhere
south of due west. Therefore,
if a person is going north, he should
keep the sun on the back and to the
right shoulder in the morning hours;
full on the back at noon, and on the
back and over the left shoulder
throughout the afternoon.</p>

<div class="container w20emmax">

<img src="images/illo124b.jpg" alt="Knife blade for sun indicator">

</div><!--container-->

<p>If the day is cloudy, set the point of
a knife blade on the thumb nail, twist
it around until the full shadow is cast
on the nail, thus indicating the position
of the sun.</p>

<p>The direction of the wind is apt to
change and for this reason is an unreliable
guide, while the so-called signs
of the woods, such as the tips of evergreen
trees pointing north, bark being
thicker on the north side of trees, or
moss growing thicker on the north side
of the trees, are by no means to be depended
upon. There is absolutely
nothing in these signs. However, every
woodsman is aware that the foliage of
trees grows somewhat thicker on the
south side, and that the branches are
rather shorter and more knotty on the
north side, but these and other signs
are scarcely infallible, and if they were,
few tenderfeet would recognize them.</p>

<p>When traveling by night, look for
the Big Dipper or Great Bear, as the
two end stars are known as the pointers,
pointing to the north star.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page122">[122]</span></p>

<h3>Marking the Trail</h3>

<p>When traveling over old and blind
trails, look for the old blaze marks,
and if doubtful about them, make new
ones by breaking down the brushes
every 15 or 20 ft., the bent part pointing
in the direction of travel. If a road
is encountered, it is easy to tell if it
is a tote or logging road, for tote roads
are crooked and wind about the trees
and rocks, while the logging road is
fairly straight and broad. Of course,
tote roads lead nowhere in particular,
but all logging roads are sure to come
to a fork and lead to water. When
breaking a new trail, blaze it by taking
a single clip from a tree from the side
it is approached, and on the opposite
side make two blazes, indicating the
way from the camp. If this is done, a
person will always know the way back
if the trail is crossed from side to side.
This is the rule of the wilderness, but
is not always observed to the letter,
for many woodsmen blaze their trail
by clipping the trees as they pass them.
Be sure to blaze your own trail correctly,
and when you come to a place
where two roads or trails fork, set a
stick to indicate the right direction.</p>

<div class="container w50emmax">

<img src="images/illo125.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">Note Some Landmark, as a Prominent
Tree, High Cliff, or Other
Conspicuous Object Lying in the
Direction of Travel and Go Directly to the
Object, and Look for the Old Blaze Marks</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>When a person becomes lost in the
woods, as every woodsman is sure to
do sometimes, sit down and think it
over. Many times a person is nearer
camp and companions than it is possible
to realize, and if a straight direction
is taken, a lumber road or a stream
will be found that will give one his
bearings. Above all, do not become
frightened. If the emergency kit and
lunch have not been forgotten, a day
and night in the woods alone is not a
hardship by any means. Avoid wasting
energy by rushing madly about
and forgetting to blaze the trail that is
being made. Bend the points of the
brushes down in the direction of travel
Do not shoot the last cartridge to attract
attention, and do not shout until
hoarse. Sit down and build a fire of
green wood, damp leaves or moss, so
that it will smoke. Build a second fire
a short distance from the first. This
is the recognized signal of the one who
is lost. The afternoon may be windy
but the wind is certain to die away at
sundown, and the smoke rising from
the fires will be visible from a considerable
distance. When an Indian gets
lost he merely camps on the spot and
awaits the next day for picking up the
trail.</p>

<p>While out on a camping trip I devised
a way to supply the camp with
cool water. A strip of heavy canvas
was cut about 2
ft. long and 1 ft.
wide, and the
edges were sewed
up to make a sack
1 ft. square. In
the upper corner
a large porcelain
knob insulator
was sewed in for
a mouth piece; the
groove around it
made a water-tight joint with the cloth.
Two metal rings were sewed in the
cloth at the top for attaching a strap
to carry it. The side and top seams
were made as tight as possible.</p>

<p>In use this sack was filled with as
cool water as possible and tightly
corked. It was then hung in the shade
where a breeze would strike it. The
water gradually seeped through the
cloth and this, in evaporating, kept the
contents cool. This sack also came in
handy while fishing or on the road.—Contributed

in at B until the mold is full, then it is
allowed to set for a minute, during

<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> GEO. J. EASTER</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>A very useful combination packing
box and camp table may be made from
a coffee or other large box. If a box
with a three-ply top is available, it
makes a neat appearance, but this is
not essential. A box, 14 in. deep, 20
in. wide, and 29 in. long, outside measurements,
is convenient, as it will slip
under the seat of a spring wagon, and
is of such a size that a person’s knees
will pass under it when used as a
table.</p>

<p class="caption">The Strips in the Corners of the Boxes
Form Sockets for the Legs</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Saw the box in two on the center
line of the narrow way, making two
uncovered boxes of the same size and
depth. The corners of each box should
be well braced on the outside, as
shown at A, <a href="#Fig124a">Fig. 1</a>. The strips B are
fastened to the inside of the box to
form sockets, C, for the legs. The
strips are ¹⁄₂ in. thick, 1¹⁄₄ in. wide,
and as long as the box is deep. Four
legs, about 12 in. long and of such size
as to fit in the sockets, are used for
holding the boxes together in transit.
Rope handles are fastened in the ends
of each box, and also a hook and eye,
which are used to lock them together.</p>

<p>To pack the boxes place one half
open side up, and insert the legs, as
shown in <a href="#Fig124a">Fig. 2</a>. Then fill it and extend
the packing to the level of the
leg ends; slip the other half of the box
on the legs, and fasten the two with
the hooks. If properly roped, such a
box will be taken as baggage. Canvas,
and other articles which will be removed
at once upon arrival in camp,
rather than provisions, should be
packed in this box, so that it can be
converted into a table with the least
possible work.</p>

<p>To make one table, or two, of the
box, remove the packing legs and insert
long legs in the sockets of each
section. A set of eight legs, 30 in.
long, take up very little space, and
can be carried diagonally in the bottom
of the box. A piece of oilcloth can be
wrapped around them and used later
as a cover for the table. The legs
should fit loosely in the sockets to
provide for the swelling in damp
weather. Ordinarily they can be
wedged to make them rigid. The table
is shown in <a href="#Fig124b">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Pictures can be mounted cheaply and
artistically on stiff paper, to make them
serviceable for decorating the summer
home or camp cottage, without having
them placed in a wooden frame. For
this purpose a “natural-surface” drawing
paper should be used, each sheet
being sufficiently large to allow a border
all around. With the picture properly
centered and marked off, the frame
can be fixed. Sets of parallel slots can
be cut all around in the border, and a
suitable ribbon drawn through so that
it is held in place only by the narrow
strips of paper. On each of the four<span class="pagenum" id="Page125">[125]</span>
corners, a rosette, or similar decoration,
can be placed. Ribbons harmonizing
with the subject of the picture
should be used; for example, a marine
scene could have a blue ribbon; fields
and brooks, some shade of green; while
flowers would probably be best set off
by some delicate pink shade.</p>

<p>Another means of decorating the border
is to choose some appropriate illustration

carbon paper all around the frame.
These figures could then be colored as
desired. Profile pictures are best for
such work, as they are most easily
traced. To be in harmony with the
picture, cuts such as captains, sailors,
or ships would be suitable for marine
scenes; soldiers and guns, for war
scenes; and trees or flowers, for landscapes.—Contributed

act as braces and supports for the table

when closed for traveling. They are
held in place under metal straps when

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>A trick which is interesting and
amusing for the entertainment of the
home audience, is performed with a
derby hat and a gentleman’s cuff. The
effect is produced as follows: The performer
takes the derby from his head
and shows that it is empty. He removes
one of his cuffs and drops it into
the hat. He tips the hat over so that
the spectators can see the inside, and
the hat appears empty. He then shakes
his arm, and the white cuff reappears,
whereupon he places the hat back on
his head. The explanation is simple:
The white cuff, dropped into the hat,
contains a false cuff link, and the inside
of the cuff is painted black. A
thread holds the cuff in shape until the
latter is dropped into the hat, when the
thread is broken without the spectators
being aware of it. The cuff just
fits into the hat, and its ends are deftly
snapped beneath the hatband, the hat
thus appearing empty. The duplicate
cuff is kept on the forearm of the performer,
and with a shake, slides into
place.—Merritt Hale, Hartford, Conn.</p>

<h2 class="lrgr nobreak">Kitchen for Hikers<br>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> PRESTON HELLER</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">W</span><span class="afterlargecap">ith</span> a view to provide all the
needs of a commissary department
for 36 boys for a period of four
days, either on a hike or in a permanent
camp, the kitchen illustrated was
constructed. As it is placed on two
wheels, which are removed when the
kitchen is in use, it can be moved from
one day’s camp to another by attaching
it to the rear of a horse-drawn
wagon by means of a shaft. When the
wheels are removed the entire outfit
rests on legs, which are swung down
from the bottom. The sides and one
end are opened by swinging one half
up and resting it on the top, while the
other half swings down to a horizontal
position where it is used as a work
board, making all parts easily accessible.</p>

<p>The outside dimensions of the
kitchen, when closed and in the form
of a large box on wheels, are 5 ft. 3 in.
long, 3 ft. wide, and 2¹⁄₂ ft. high. The
main feature of this entire kitchen is
its compactness. At the front, and extending
about 1 ft. back, is a kitchen
cabinet where the plates, sugar, salt,
flour, etc., are kept in separate compartments.
Here also are found the
necessary cooking utensils, such as
bread knives, butcher knives, cleaver,
cooking spoons, pancake turner, sieves,
large forks, lemon squeezer, etc.; and
on the shelves of galvanized iron small
boxes and packages of baking powder,
cocoa, etc., are placed. This entire
compartment, as well as all others
where food is handled and prepared, is
lined with No. 28 gauge galvanized iron
which makes sanitation a feature also.</p>

<p>Upon passing around to one side
there can be seen a large three-shelved
oven, 21 in. wide, which is heated by
a gasoline burner. Between the burner
and the bottom of the oven are located
coils of pipe for heating water, and
these coils are connected with a tank
of 7-gal. capacity, located just above
the oven. An air valve and glass
gauge are attached to the tank.</p>

<p>The next compartment to the rear
is a large storage space, extending all
the way through the kitchen, and a
2¹⁄₂-gal. forged-copper gasoline tank
occupies a shelf in the upper portion of
this space. At the rear end along this
side are located nickelplated faucets
which are connected with the hot-water
tank mentioned; a 7-gal., white
enameled milk tank above; an 18-gal.
cold-water tank, and an ice-water tank,
used when distilled-water ice can be
secured. These faucets all drain into
a small sink, which, in turn, drains off
through an ordinary sink drain to a
hole dug in the ground beneath it.
Practically the entire rear end of
the kitchen is occupied by the large
water tanks, ice box, and milk tanks,
with the exception of a small space at
the bottom where the silverware is
kept in a drawer.</p>

<p>On the other side, and to the rear,
two compartments above and below
the large water tank form excellent
storage space for ham, bacon, sausage,
preserves, butter, etc., which need to
be kept in a cool place. Next in line
is the other end of the large storage
place which extends through from the
other side. Pans, pails, canned goods,
larger packages, etc., are kept in this
space.</p>

<p>Immediately to the rear of the
kitchen cabinet, on this side, are located
compartment shelves where the
tin cups are kept, and adjoining this is
found a three-compartment steam
cooker. By having the cups and plates
near this steam cooker, which is also
heated by a gas burner, there is less
danger from rust, as they are kept thoroughly
dried. Wherever there is a gasoline
burner the compartment in which
it is located is not only lined with galvanized
iron, but asbestos in sheets is
placed on the inner side, so that the
heat will not ignite the interior packing
or the woodwork. The tanks are accessible
from the top of the kitchen for
filling and cleaning, and are packed
with ground cork.</p>

<p>The kitchen has shown its efficiency
by giving satisfactory service in camps
of many members.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">How to Wind Wire on Electrical
Apparatus</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>When a beginner, it was the despair
of the writer to try to produce in his
homemade apparatus the mathematical
regularity and perfection of the winding
on the coils of electrical instruments
in the supply stores, but when
he found that this professional and
workmanlike finish could be obtained
by means of a simple contrivance, and
a little care and attention to details before
beginning, experimental work
took on a new interest.</p>

<p>At the outset let it be stated that
wire should never be wound directly
on the iron core, not only because it
cannot be done satisfactorily in that
manner, but for the reason that it is
often desired to remove a coil from a
piece of apparatus after it has served its
purpose. It is therefore advisable to
make a bobbin, which consists of a
thin, hard tube with two ends. The
tube may be easily formed by wrapping
a suitable length of medium-weight paper
on the core, having first coated it
with ordinary fish glue, excepting, of
course, the first 2 or 3 in. in direct contact
with the core. Wind tightly until
the thickness is from ¹⁄₃₂ in. to ¹⁄₁₆ in.,
depending upon the diameter of the
core, and then wrap with string until
the glue hardens, after which the tube
may be sandpapered and trimmed up as
desired.</p>

<p>Where the wire is not of too small
a gauge and is not to be wound to too
great a depth, no ends will be necessary
if each layer of wire is stopped
one-half turn before the preceding one,
as indicated in the accompanying<span class="pagenum" id="Page137">[137]</span>
sketch, and is also thoroughly shellacked.
With ordinary care magnet
wire may be wound in this manner to
a depth of over one-half inch.</p>

<img src="images/illo141a.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">Winding a Coil of Wire so That the Layers will be
Even and Smooth</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The tube having been made ready,
with or without ends as may be necessary,
the small winding jig illustrated
is to be made. All that is essential is
to provide a suitable means for rotating
by hand a slightly tapering wood
spindle, upon which the tube is to be
pushed. The bearings can be just
notches made in the upper ends of two
standards, through each of which a
hole is drilled at right angles to the
length of the spindle, so that some
string or wire may be laced through
in order to hold the spindle down. A
crank may be formed by winding a
piece of heavy wire around the larger
end of the spindle. A loop of wire, or
string, is to be attached at some convenient
point, so that the crank may be
held from unwinding while adjusting
matters at the end of each layer, or
while making a connection. There
should also be provided a suitable support
for the spool of wire, which is generally
placed below the table to good
advantage. Much depends, in this sort
of work, upon attention to these small
details, after which it will be found that
the actual winding will require very
little time.—Contributed by John D.

<p>The basket was made as follows:
The peach baskets were wired together
at their bottoms. A piece of silk was
cut, wide enough to reach from the top
to the bottom of the joined baskets and
to permit the folding over of a portion
at the top and bottom. One long edge
of the piece was glued to the inner edge
of the bottom and drawn in around the
sides to form neat folds. The upper
edge of the silk was then glued in the
top, being folded over the edge.</p>

<p>A cord was fixed around the middle
of the basket, as shown in the sketch.<span class="pagenum" id="Page138">[138]</span>
A lining was glued into the top and
bottom. It was folded and stitched
along its edges to prevent raveling and
to give a smooth finish. The bottom
need not be lined, but it is desirable to
have it so.</p>

<p>The pincushion was made by padding
a block with cotton and then covering
it with silk. A cardboard box
may be used instead. The cushion was
nailed into place from the bottom. Ribbon
may be used to draw the silk to the
sides of the basket at the middle, and
a cushion may be made entirely of cotton

<p>Mount a horseshoe magnet on a

of a triangle opposite the poles of the
magnet, N and S. Suspend a long,
narrow bar magnet on a universal joint
from a standard. A pin projects into
the groove from the lower end, which
is its north pole, and can move only
along the triangular course.</p>

<p>Start the device with the suspended
magnet in the position shown. The
lower end will tend to move in the direction
of the arrows, because in so
doing it is getting farther away from
the repelling north pole of the horseshoe
magnet and nearer the attracting
south pole, which action will bring it
to the corner of the triangle in the foreground.
It will next move down the
side as indicated by the arrow, because
along that line it is nearer the attracting
south than the repelling north
pole. When it reaches the end of its
trip, at the angle between the poles of
the magnet, the attraction and repulsion
will be balanced, but a slight jar
will carry the traveler beyond the
angle.</p>

<p>The third leg of the triangle will be
covered similarly, the north pole repelling
the traveler. On this basis the
motion should continue indefinitely,
but a test will show that it will not
do so.</p>

<p>The corners of the triangle should
be rounded slightly and it would be
better to use several hanging magnets,
flexibly connected, so that when one
is at the dead center the others will
carry the traveler on.</p>

Such

cut at one end, as shown, so that when
the coal was poured into the hopper, it
would feed out. A truck, mounted on
casters, was made, 12 in. wide, 5 in.

<p>Falling snowflakes in a camera
photograph—the large feathery, slow
falling kind—often make an exquisitely
beautiful picture out of a commonplace

of the attempts to get them prove failures,
the photographer—usually an

that is free from falling flakes
by the use of a shelter such as a tree

in cloudy weather will not stop the
motion of the flakes nearest the camera
and these passing through greater
angles of space in equal length of time
than those farther away, will blur on
the negative. We made some excellent
outdoor views in deep snow, while

splendidly decorating the darker regions
of figures and foliage, by holding
a felt hat and two umbrellas in a line

<p>When a wooden box with a hinged

hinges unnecessary,
and is serviceable
even for

Where hinges
projecting from

turn was supported by a nail, to which
was attached a string. The flash was

which dropped the weight. This contrivance
I concealed in the chicken

<p>To perform the trick advance with
the piece of glass hidden between the
second and third fingers of the left

finger of the same hand and the handkerchief
in the right hand. Throw the
handkerchief over the left hand and
gather up the glass piece in the fold

into the palm of the left hand while
covered. Remove the left hand and
hold out the piece of glass with the
handkerchief drawn tightly around it.
Anyone can touch the cloth-covered
glass, but it cannot be distinguished
from the quarter. While this is being
shown slip the quarter into a pocket.
Spread the handkerchief over the glass

<h3>The Head</h3>

<p>The head requires
much more
work than any of
the other sections. There are two
principal rings to this section,
as shown in <a href="#Fig146a">Fig.
1</a>. The inner ring is
the more important, the
outer one being added for the protection
of the points when alighting.
The construction of the framework is
shown in <a href="#Fig146b">Fig. 2</a>. It is made entirely of
bamboo. The bamboo is split into
strips, about ³⁄₁₆ in. wide, for the ring
A. As the bamboo strips will be much
too thick, they must be pared down to
less than ¹⁄₁₆ in. The diameter of the
ring A is 12 in., and a strip of bamboo to
make this ring should be about 38 in.
long, so that there will be some end for
making a lap joint. The ends of the strip
are held securely together by winding
them with linen thread. The Chinese
boys use strips of rice paper, about ¹⁄₂
in. wide and torn lengthwise of the paper.
The rice-paper strips are made
wet with paste before winding them on
the joint, and when they dry out the
shrinkage will bind the ends securely.</p>

<p>Two crosspieces, of the same weight
as the ring stick, are placed 3¹⁄₂ in.
apart, at equal distances from the center
and parallel, as shown at B and C.
The ends of these pieces are turned at
a sharp angle and lashed to the inside
surface of the ring A. To make these
bends, heat the bamboo over a candle
flame until it will give under pressure,
then bend and it will stay in shape after
it becomes cold. This method of bending
should be remembered, as it is useful
in making all kinds of kites. Two<span class="pagenum" id="Page146">[146]</span>
small rings, each 3¹⁄₂ in. in diameter,
are put in between the two parallel
pieces, as shown at D and E. These
are for the eyes of the dragon. The
rings are lashed to the two crosspieces
B and C. As the eyes revolve in the
rings they should be made perfectly
true. This can be done by shaping the
bamboo about a perfectly round cylinder,
3¹⁄₂ in. in diameter. To stiffen the
whole framework, two pieces of bamboo,
¹⁄₁₆ in. thick, ¹⁄₈ in. wide, and 20 in.
long, are lashed to the back as shown
by F and G. There is a space of 3 in.
between the inner ring A and the outer
ring H, giving the latter a diameter of
18 in. It is made of a bamboo strip,
¹⁄₈ in. wide, and should be less than ¹⁄₁₆
in. thick. It may be necessary to make
this large ring from two pieces of bamboo,
to get the length, and in such
case be careful to make a perfect ring
with the ends well lashed together.
Two short pieces are lashed to the
two rings, as shown at J and K. The
supports for the horns consist of two
pieces, ¹⁄₈ in. wide and less than ¹⁄₁₆
in. thick, and they are lashed to the
upper crosspiece and to both rings, so
that the parts L and M are exactly
halfway between the ends of the pieces
F and G and radiate out from the center
of the ring A, the other parts, N and O,
pointing to the center of the eye rings,
respectively. The ears are unimportant
and may be put on if desired. The
rings on the horns and the stick ends
may be from ¹⁄₂ to 2 in. in diameter,
cut from stiff paper, but if larger, made
of bamboo.</p>

<p>Chinese rice paper is the best material
for covering, and it should be
stretched tightly so that there will be
no buckling or bagging places. The
only part covered is that inside of the
inner ring A, the horns, and the ears,
leaving the eye rings open. The shades
are put on with a brush and water colors,
leaving the face white, or it can be
tinted in brilliant colors. Leave the
horns white and color the tongue red.</p>

<h3>The Eyes</h3>

<p>The frame for each eye is made of
bamboo, pared down to ¹⁄₃₂ in. in thickness
and formed into a perfect ring, 3¹⁄₄
in. in diameter. Each ring revolves on
an axle made of wire passed through
the bamboo exactly on the diameter, as
shown at P, <a href="#Fig147a">Fig. 3</a>. The wire should
be long enough to pass through the
socket ring D or E, <a href="#Fig146b">Fig. 2</a>, also, and
after the eye ring is in place in the
socket ring and the axle adjusted, the
latter is fastened to the eye ring with
a strip of paper wrapped tightly around
the wire and pasted to the bamboo of<span class="pagenum" id="Page147">[147]</span>
the ring. A glass bead, placed on the
wire axle between the socket rings D
or E and the eye ring Q on each side,
keeps them apart and the revolving one
from striking the other.</p>

<p>Each side of the eye ring is covered
halfway with rice paper, as shown in
<a href="#Fig147a">Fig. 4</a>. The part R is on the upper
front half, and that shown by S is on
the back lower half. Placing the two
halves in this manner causes an unequal
pressure of the wind on the whole
eyepiece, and thus causes it to revolve
on the axle. The front upper half of
the eyepiece is made black, and the
smaller dark portion extending below
the darkened half is a round piece of
paper placed just between the two
halves so that half of it will show on
both front and back of the eyepiece.
When the eyepiece is given a half turn
in its socket the back side will come to
the front and will appear just the same
as the other side. Some kite builders
add pieces of mirror glass to the eyes,
to reflect the light and cause flashes as
the eyes revolve in their sockets.</p>

<h3>A Section Kite</h3>

<p>The ring for the section kite is made
the same size as the inner ring of the
head kite, or in this case 12 in. in diameter.
The bamboo for making this ring
should be ¹⁄₈ in. wide and ¹⁄₁₆ in. thick.
The balancer stick, 36 in. long, is located
about the same place as the cross-stick
F, as shown in <a href="#Fig146b">Fig. 2</a>, and must
be made small, light and well balanced.
Small tufts of tissue paper, or feathers,
are attached to the tip ends of the balancer
sticks, as shown in <a href="#Fig147b">Fig. 5</a>. The
cover for the section kite is put on
tightly, the same as for the head, the
colors indicated in the sketch being
only suggestions, as the builder can
color them as desired. The balancer
on the last section should have streamers,
as shown in <a href="#Fig147b">Fig. 6</a>, for a finish.
The streamers are made of light cloth.</p>

<p class="caption">The Section Kites Have Balancers and the Disks are Given Bright Colors So That They will Produce
the Effect of a Great Dragon When in the Air, the Head Piece Having a Ball
Balancer Hanging from the Under Edge</p>

</div><!--container-->

<h3>The Harness</h3>

<p>As previously stated, 20, more or less,
sections can be used, and the number
means so many separate kites which
are joined together with three long
cords, spacing the sections 30 in. apart.
The cords should be as long as the kite
from the head to the tail, allowing sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page148">[148]</span>
extra length for the knots. As
such a kite will make a hard pull, the
cord used should be a six-ply, hard-twisted
seine twine. Start by tying
the three long cords to the head kite
at the points T, U, and V, <a href="#Fig146b">Fig. 2</a>. Tie
the next section at corresponding
places just 30 in. from the head kite.
The construction will be much easier
if the head kite is fastened to a wall so
that each cord may be drawn out to its
proper length. Continue the tying
until all sections are attached just 30 in.
apart. Other spacing can be used, but
the distance selected must be uniform
throughout the length of the kite. The
individual kites, or sections, may vary
in size, or they can all be 9 in. in diameter,
instead of 12 in., and the balancer
sticks 30 in. long instead of 36 in., but
a kite of uniform sections is much better
and is easier to make. The positions
of the sections as they will appear
in the kite are shown in <a href="#Fig147b">Fig. 7</a>.</p>

<h3>The Bridle</h3>

<p>The Chinese bridle is usually made
of three strings, which are attached to
the same points on the head kite as the
harness cords, or at T, U, and V. The
lower string is longer than the two
upper ones so that the proper inclination
will be presented to the breeze.
As the head is inclined, all the section
kites will also be inclined. Some
makers prefer a balancer on the head
kite, and in one instance such a balancer
was made in the shape of a ball.
A ball made of bamboo strips is shown
in <a href="#Fig147b">Fig. 8</a>, and is attached as shown in
<a href="#Fig147b">Fig. 7</a>.</p>

<h3>Flying the Kite</h3>

<p>It will be necessary to have a helper,
and perhaps two, in starting the kite
up, as the harness might become entangled.
Quite a little run will be necessary,
but when up the kite will make a
steady flier and will pull very hard. If
the first attempt is unsuccessful, try readjustment
of the bridle or a little different
position in the breeze, and see
that the balancers are not tangled.
Quite a number of changes may be
worked out on these plans, but it is
necessary to bear in mind that the distances
between sections must be equal
and that the general construction must
be maintained.</p>

<p>Tennis courts are very apt to become
covered with grass and weeds
unless considerable labor is expended
on them. The best way to keep a court
free from this growth is to put on
sheets of tar paper close together when
it is not in use. The paper should be
cut in strips the proper length, so that
they can be rolled up and set aside until
the game is over, when they can be laid
down again. After the court has been
covered a few times, the grass will
die out and disappear altogether. The
use of salt, acids, and a number of other
things, together with hoeing, were tried
out, but the paper covering was the
most successful of them all.—Contributed

are many who take special delight in
tray development, because they enjoy
seeing the picture as it develops on the

<p>There are many of this class of photographers

Many schemes have been used, but
there is none simpler than that shown

than letting the developing tray float

among amateurs who are compelled to
use the bathroom as a dark room.</p>

<p>Any tinsmith can make a water-jacketed

one expects to use it for developing
films by hand, it should be made relatively
deep, or at least shaped so that
whatever method is used in manipulating

<p>Push buttons are frequently put in
hallways, or other places, not accessible
when the screen doors are hooked
shut. By connecting an extra button
on the screen door with the regular
doorbell line, the service can be made
to go on uninterrupted whether the

<p>To do this, one wire, carefully insulated,
from the outside button is
laid under the upper molding strip of
the screen, as shown, coming out
through the hinge and passing down
to the battery line, being concealed in
any suitable manner, by molding or
within the door frame. The button
circuit is completed by connecting it to
the screen with a short wire, the screen
then acting as a conductor. If preferred,
the line may be run down under
the screen-door molding, and out
through the bottom hinge same as with
the other wire at the top. If the screen
is used as conductor, a piece of wire
should be connected to it near the bottom,
and led through the hinge as before.
In either case, after leaving the
hinge, the wire must be led and connected
to the battery line, to complete
the circuit. It is then possible to
operate the bell either from outside of
the screen door or at the regular place
within.—Contributed by E. M. Davis,

<h2 class="nobreak">Working Wood by the Application
of Heat</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>It is often desirable to fit a piece of
wood into a piece of metal by means
of cutting a thread in the metal and
screwing the wood therein. This can
be accomplished by heating the metal
to a little over the boiling point of
water and screwing the wood piece
into the metal while hot; or, if this is
impractical on account of size, to heat
the metal, make a screw plate by cutting
a thread in a small piece of metal,
the size and thread corresponding to
the hole into which the wood piece is
to be inserted, and heating it to the
required temperature, then running the
wood with some pressure through
the thread. The wood then can be
screwed into the larger piece, where it
will hold firmly.</p>

<p>The process of heating wood without
the aid of steam can be used to
advantage in a number of ways; for
instance, a hammer handle that is
crooked can be straightened by careful
heating without burning; also billiard
cues, or almost anything of hard wood.
It is surprising how easily it is done
and how permanent the repair will be.
The Indians at one time made their
arrows from small hardwood twigs
which were almost always crooked
to start with, but after being dried
they were warmed over a fire and
straightened.</p>

<p>Another use for the application of
heat is as follows: When it is desired
to place a screw in a fragile piece of
wood that is likely to split, if the screw
is heated to a blue color and turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page151">[151]</span>
into the wood while hot, there will
be scarcely any danger of splitting. In
this case do not try to use oil or a
lubricant of any kind, as the screw is
sure to set before it is in place.—Contributed

<h2 class="nobreak">Reproducing Flowers and Leaves in
Colors</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>A very cheap, easy, and quick way to
make reproductions of flowers, leaves,
insects, butterflies, etc., is the following:
Purchase 1 oz. of bichromate of
potash and dissolve it in water. Spread
this fluid over the surface of the paper
upon which the picture is to be made,
using a soft brush, and place it in a
dark room to dry. When dry it will be
a light lemon color.</p>

<p>The leaf, or part to be reproduced,
is placed upon the yellow side of the
paper and the whole exposed to the
sunlight. The uncovered portions will
gradually turn brown, while the part
covered by the object will remain a
lemon color. When the desired shade
of brown is attained, remove the paper
from the sunlight, and the image of
the object will be on the paper.</p>

<p>Go over the outline with crayons or
colors, and fill in the print according to
the natural colors. Very beautiful pictures
may be made in this way, and a
butterfly made up in natural colors on
a dark-brown ground is very pretty.
These prints, uncolored, will keep for
some time, if they are not exposed to a
strong light.</p>

<p>Washing as ordinary photographic
prints are treated will improve them a

many beautiful objects can be preserved

<p>The supports for holding the dishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page153">[153]</span>

into two wood hoops that snugly fit the
inside of the tank, one near the bottom
and the other about 9 in. above the
first one. The wires are set about 1¹⁄₂
in. apart and radiate from the center
like wire spokes in a wheel.</p>

<p>A funnel-shaped piece, having a hole
5 in. in diameter in the center, is made
of mesh wire and hung in place with
several wires running to the upper edge
of the tank. Hooks are attached to the
edge of the hole on which cups and
glasses are hung.</p>

<p>The cover consists of a wood disk,
with a hole bored in its center for a
¹⁄₂-in. pipe. The piece of pipe used
should be 3 or 4 in. longer than the
depth of the tank. A long thread is cut
on the lower end of the pipe, and two
rectangular holes are cut in the pipe
end through the threaded part. These
holes are made by cutting through the
pipe as if making a slot for a key. Two
large nuts are run on the threads of the
pipe. These nuts should be thick
enough to cover the slot in the pipe.
A pipe cap is then screwed on the end
of the pipe. The upper end of the
pipe is attached to a hose connected to
the hot-water faucet. By separating
the two nuts just a little, a fine spray
of water will be forced out of the
holes.</p>

<p>When the dishes are in place the
spray of hot water can be directed over
them by moving the pipe up and down
through the hole in the cover.</p>

<p>After the dishes are washed sufficiently
the hose is removed and the
tank placed over a gas jet so that the
heat will pass up through the funnel-shaped
attachment in the bottom of the
tank. The dishes, already heated by
the hot water, soon dry in the heat
from the gas jet. If desired, the tank
can be allowed to remain over the jet
until the next meal is ready to serve,

one, 1 ft. long by ¹⁄₄ by ¹⁄₄ in. About
five sheets of tissue paper will be required,
but more may be needed for
color combinations. The so-called
French tissue paper is much better, as
it comes in fine colors and is much
stronger than the ordinary tissue. It
costs a trifle more, but it pays in making
a beautiful kite. The Chinese rice
paper is the strongest, but it comes only

The bow sticks should be lashed

around the two sticks, both left
and right, then wind between the two,<span class="pagenum" id="Page156">[156]</span>

all windings up tightly to prevent slipping.</p>

<p>To string up the upper kite, drill a
small hole through the spine, 6 in. from
the top, at A, and also 6 in. from each
end of the bow stick, at B and C. If
a small drill is not available, notch
the stick with a knife or saw to hold
the string. Another hole is made in
the spine 29 in. from the upper bow
stick, or at D. Tie the outline string
at A, then pass through the hole at C,
then through D, up through B and back
to the starting point at A. In tying

slits with scissors at intervals of 1 in.
along the loose edge. After the fringe

tightly, but give sufficient looseness to
make each length form a graceful
curve and keep the sides well balanced.</p>

<p>To bend the bows of the upper and
center kites, attach a string from end
to end of each bow on the back side of
the kite and spring in short brace sticks
in the manner usual for tailless kites.</p>

<p>Attach the upper end of the bridle
at A. The length of the bridle string
is 87 in. and the kite line is attached
to it 30 in. from A, leaving the lower
part from this point to F, where it is
tied to the spine, 57 in. long.</p>

<p>The kite should fly without a tail,
but if it dodges too much, attach extra
streamers to the ends of the bow sticks
of the lower kite, and to the bottom of
the spine.</p>

<p>If good combinations of colors are

<img src="images/illo160.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">A Small Coil of Wire Mounted on a Cork
Floating in Dilute Sulphuric Acid</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The following simple experiment,
which may be easily performed, will
serve to prove the theory that there
is a magnetic field produced about a
conductor carrying a current, and that
there is a definite relation between the
direction of the current in the conductor
and the direction, or polarity, of
the magnetic field produced by the current.
The current in the experiment
is to be produced by a battery consisting
of a small copper and zinc plate
fastened to the under side of a large
flat cork, as shown in the sketch, the
whole being placed in a glass or rubber
vessel partly filled with diluted sulphuric
acid. A small coil of wire is
formed and mounted on top of the cork,
and its terminals are connected to the
copper and zinc plates. The electromotive
force generated will cause a
current to circulate through the coil
from the copper plate to the zinc plate.
If the poles of a permanent magnet be
presented in turn to the same side of
the coil it will be found that there is a
force of attraction between one pole of
the permanent magnet and the coil,
and a force of repulsion between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page157">[157]</span>
other pole and the coil. If the same
operation be performed on the opposite
side of the coil, it will be found
that the force between the poles of the
magnet and the coil are just the reverse
of what they were in the first case;
that is, the pole that attracted the coil
in the first case will now repel it, and
the one that repelled it, will now attract
it. Applying one of the fundamental
laws of magnetism—like poles
attract and unlike repel each other—it
can be readily seen that the two sides
of the coil are of opposite magnetic
polarity.</p>

<p>If the direction of the current around
the coil be changed, the action between
the coil and the magnet will be opposite
to what it was originally, and if
the plates be placed in clean water,
there will be no current and no attraction
or repulsion between the coil
and the poles of the magnet.</p>

<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> CHARLES M. MILLER</span></h2>

</div><!--container-->

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">N</span><span class="afterlargecap">early</span> every boy can make kites
of the several common varieties
without special directions. For the boy
who wants a kite that is not like those
every other boy makes, an eight-pointed
star kite, decorated in an original
and interesting manner, in various
colors, is well worth while, even if it
requires more careful work, and extra
time. The star kite shown in <a href="#Fig159b">Fig. 1</a> is
simple in construction, and if carefully
made, will fly to a great height. It is
balanced by streamers instead of the
common type of kite tail. Any regular-shaped
kite should be laid out accurately,
as otherwise the error appears
very prominent, and unbalances the
poise of the kite.</p>

<p>The frame for this star kite is made
of four sticks, joined, as indicated in
<a href="#Fig159b">Fig. 5</a>, with strings running from one
corner to the second corner beyond, as
from A to C, from C to E, etc. A little
notching of each pair of sticks lessens
the thickness of the sticks at the center
crossing, and strengthens the frame,
The sticks are ¹⁄₄ by ¹⁄₂ in. by 4 ft. long,
They are set at right angles to each
other in pairs, and lashed together with
cord, and also held by a ³⁄₄-in. brad at
the center. The strings that form the
sides of the squares, A to G, and B to
H, must be equal in length when tied.
The points where the strings forming
the squares cross each other and the
sticks are also tied.</p>

<p>The first cover, which is put on with
paste, laying it out on a smooth floor
or table as usual in kite making, is plain
light-colored paper. The darker decorations
are pasted onto this. The outside
edges of the cover are turned over
the string outline, and pasted down.
The colors may be in many combinations,
as red and white, purple and gold,
green and white, etc. Brilliant and contrasting
colors are best. The decoration
may proceed from the center out,
or the reverse. The outside edge in the
design shown has a 1¹⁄₂-in. black stripe.
The figures are black. The next octagonal
black line binds the design together.
The points of the star are dark
blue, with a gilt stripe on each. The
center design is done in black, dark
blue, and gilt.</p>

<p>The flags are tied on, and the tassels

streamers are at least 6 ft. long, and
balanced carefully. Ribbons, or dark-colored
lining cambric, are used for
them. The funnel-shaped ends balance
the kite. They are shown in detail in
<a href="#Fig159b">Figs. 2, 3, and 4</a>, and have 1-in. openings
at the bottom, through which the
air passes, causing a pull that steadies
the kite. They are of dark blue, and the
cloth fringe is of light blue. A thin
reed, or fine wire, is used for the hoop
which stiffens the top. Heavy wrapping
or cover paper is used to cover the
hoops. It is cut as shown in <a href="#Fig159b">Fig. 4</a> and
rolled into shape.</p>

<p>A four-string bridle is fastened to the
frame at I, J, K, and L, as shown. The
upper strings are each 18 in., and the

<h2 class="lrgr nobreak">How to Make a Model Old-Four Monoplane<br>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> RALPH M. BROWN</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">T</span><span class="afterlargecap">he</span> old-four monoplane model,
made famous by its wonderful
flights, is one of the most graceful that
has been built. Its large size and slow,
even glide make it a much more desirable
flier than the ordinary dartlike
model. It gives one a true insight into
the phenomena of heavier-than-air
flight. This machine, when complete,
should weigh 9 oz. and fly 1,200 ft., rising
from the ground under its own
power and landing lightly. Its construction
is
simple, and
with careful
reference to
the sketches,
an exact reproduction
may
be made.</p>

<p>For the motor
bases, A,
<a href="#Fig164">Fig. 1</a>, secure
two spruce
sticks, each 48
in. long, ³⁄₈ in.
wide, and ¹⁄₄
in. thick, and
fasten a wire
hook on one
end of each
stick with
thread wound around after giving it a
coat of glue. These hooks are to hold
one end of the rubber bands that act as
the motive power, and are designated
by the letter B. At the opposite ends of
the sticks, at C, bearings are provided,
which consist of blocks of wood, each
1 in. long, 1 in. wide, and ³⁄₈ in. thick.
These are also bound in place with
thread after gluing them. Holes are
drilled through the blocks lengthwise
and then lined with bushings made of
brass tubing, ¹⁄₁₆ in. in inside diameter.
The two motor bases A are connected
with four cross sticks, D, each 9 in.
long and ³⁄₁₆ in. square. These are
bound and glued on the under side, one
near each end and the others equidistant
each from the other and from the
nearest end stick. The front bumper
E is made of round rattan, ¹⁄₈ in. in diameter.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The alighting gear is next in order
of construction. This is made as shown
entirely of
bamboo, ³⁄₁₆
in. square.
The pieces
marked F are
11 in. long; G,
9¹⁄₂ in. long,
and the cross
bar H, 11 in.
long. At the
rear, the pieces
J are 13 in.
long; K, 4¹⁄₂
in. long, and
the cross piece
L, 11 in. long.
The distance
between the
points M and
N, <a href="#Fig165a">Fig. 2</a>, is 6
in., and between O and P, 9 in. The
bamboo is easily curved by wetting and
holding it for an instant in the flame
of a candle. It will hold its shape
just as soon as it becomes cold. The
wheels are made of tin, 1¹⁄₂ in. in diameter,
borrowed from a toy automobile.
The axles are made from wire,
¹⁄₁₆ in. in diameter.</p>

<p>The wing spars Q are made of
spruce, ³⁄₁₆ in. wide and ¹⁄₄ in. thick.
Those for the front are 30 in. long, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page164">[164]</span>
for the rear, 36 in. long. The ribs R
are made of bamboo pieces, ¹⁄₁₆ in.
square, 5 in. long for the front plane,
and 6 in. for the rear. These are bound
and glued on top of the spars, 3 in.
apart. They are given a slight upward
curve. The round ends are made of
¹⁄₁₆-in. rattan.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>It is rather difficult to make good
propellers, but with a little time and
patience they can be shaped and formed
into good proportions. Procure two
clear, straight-grained blocks of white
pine, 8 in. long, 1¹⁄₂ in. wide, and ³⁄₄
in. thick. Draw a diagonal line on one
block from opposite corners, as shown
at S, <a href="#Fig165b">Fig. 3</a>, then on the other block
T, draw the line in an opposite direction.
Turn the blocks over and draw
opposite diagonals, as shown by the
dotted lines. Draw a circle on each
side exactly in the center, ¹⁄₂ in. in diameter.
Drill ¹⁄₁₆-in. holes through the
centers of the circles for the propeller
shafts. The wood is then cut down to
the lines drawn, leaving only enough
material so that they will not break
easily. The face of the blades should
be flat and the back rounded. Leave
plenty of stock near the hub. After
the faces have been finished, the blades
are shaped as shown at U. The propellers
should be finished with sandpaper
to make them perfectly smooth,
as much of the success of the model
will depend upon them. It will be a
good plan to shellac them, and also
the frame and the alighting gear.
Aluminum paint costs but little, and it
makes a fine finish for a model aeroplane.</p>

<p>The propeller shafts V, <a href="#Fig164">Fig. 1</a>, <a href="#Fig165a">2</a>, and
<a href="#Fig166a">4</a>, are cut from bicycle spokes. An eye
for the rubber band is bent in the
spoke, about 2 in. from the threaded
end. The end having the threads is
run through the bearing block C, <a href="#Fig166a">Fig.
4</a>, and the propeller fastened on with
a small washer on each side of it by
means of two nuts, W, cut from a bicycle
nipple. These nuts may be turned
up tightly with pliers.</p>

<p>The planes are covered with tissue
paper put on tightly over the tops of
the ribs, using a flour paste. The
planes are movably fixed on the motor
bases A by tying at the four points of
contact with rubber bands. This makes
it possible to adjust the fore-and-aft
balance of the machine by changing the
position of the planes.</p>

<p>The motive power, which is the most
important part of the entire machine,
consists of rubber bands. There are
three ways of obtaining these bands.
It is best, if possible, to purchase them
from an aeroplane supply house. In
this case, procure about 100 ft. of ¹⁄₁₆-in.
square rubber, 50 ft. for each side.
These are wound closely between the
hooks X. This rubber can be taken
from a golf ball. It will require about
40 strands of this rubber, which is removed
by cutting into the ball, on each
propeller. Another way of obtaining
the bands is to purchase No. 19 rubber<span class="pagenum" id="Page165">[165]</span>
bands and loop them together, chain-fashion,
to make them long enough to
reach between the hooks without
stretching. About 30 strands on each
propeller will be sufficient. The hooks
X are made in the shape of the letter
“S,” to provide a way for taking out
the rubber bands quickly. To prevent
the hooks from cutting the rubber, slip
some ¹⁄₁₆-in. rubber tubing over them.
The rubber bands, or motor, when not
in use, should be kept in a cool, dark
place and powdered with French chalk
to prevent the parts from sticking together.</p>

<p>With the model complete, flying is
the next thing in order. With a machine
as large as this one, quite a field
will be necessary to give it a good
flight. Test the plane by gliding it,
that is, holding it up by the propellers
and bearing blocks on a level with your
head and throwing it forward on an
even keel. Shift the planes forward or
back until it balances and comes to the
ground lightly.</p>

<p>Winding up the propellers is accomplished
by means of an eye inserted
in the chuck of an ordinary hand
drill. While an assistant grasps the
propellers and motor bearings the rubber
is unhooked from the front of the
machine and hooked into the eye in the
drill. Stretch the rubber out for about
10 ft., and as it is wound up, let it draw
back gradually. Wind up the propellers
in opposite directions, turning
them from 400 to 800 revolutions. Be
sure to wind both propellers the same
number of turns, as this will assure a
straight flight.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 3</span><br>
The Most Difficult Part of Making the Propellers can
be Overcome with a Little Patience</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Set the machine on the ground and
release both propellers at once, and at
the same time push it forward. If
everything is properly constructed and
well balanced, the mechanical bird will
run about 5 ft. on the ground and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page166">[166]</span>
rise to 15 or 20 ft. and fly from 800
to 1,200 ft., descending in a long glide
and alighting gracefully.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 4</span><br>
The Motive Power, Which Is the Most Important
Part of the Machine, Consists of Rubber Bands</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>If the machine fails to rise, move the
forward plane toward the front. If it
climbs up suddenly and hangs in the air
and falls back on its tail, move it toward
the back.</p>

<p>After the novelty of overland flights
has worn off, try flights over the water.
To do this the wheels must be removed
and four pontoons put in their place,
as shown by the dotted lines in <a href="#Fig165a">Fig. 2</a>.
The pontoons are made over a light
frame, constructed as shown in <a href="#Fig166b">Fig. 5</a>.
The frame pieces are bamboo, ¹⁄₈ in.
square. Each one is 8 in. long, 4 in.
wide, and 2 in. deep. The covering
consists of writing paper glued in place,
after which the whole surface is covered
with melted paraffin to make it
water-tight.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 5</span><br>
Framework for Constructing Pontoons by Covering
Them with Writing Paper Soaked in Paraffin</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>No doubt various methods will be
suggested by the time such flights are
made, such as smaller planes for racing,
larger ones for altitude and duration,
etc. To make the machine carry
weights, build a duplicate set of planes
and fasten them 6 in. above the others
by means of struts, ³⁄₁₆ in. square, forming
a tandem biplane, as shown by the
dotted lines in <a href="#Fig165a">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p>Patience is the one thing necessary
in model budding. Sometimes a machine
carefully made will not fly, and
no one can make it do so until some
seemingly unimportant alteration is
made.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">How to Make a Pair of Trammels</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>The making of these trammels is a
very nice workshop problem for a
school, as it requires a very small
amount of stock and a corresponding
degree of skill, and at the same time
adds a little something to the general
shop equipment.</p>

<p>The brass is best procured in strips,
which may be had in different widths,
except the bar, which is ¹⁄₄ in. thick and
not less than ³⁄₄ in. wide. The steel for
the points may be the ordinary steel,
or if the trammels are to be used on
woodwork, very satisfactory points can
be made of heavy nails.</p>

<div class="container w35emmax">

<img src="images/illo170c.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">Trammel Points
Made of a Nail
and a Brass
Strip to Fit
the Bar</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Cut two pieces of brass, 4¹⁄₄ in. long,
and straighten them with a wood or
rawhide mallet on a surface plate.
Draw center lines both ways through
each piece and lay out the openings for
the bar with a sharp scriber, and make
a center-punch mark for the ¹⁄₈-in. hole
that is to be drilled at the intersection
of the center lines. Mark the lines
where the piece is to be bent, and with
a pair of dividers lay out the ends and
shape them with a file.</p>

<p>The center hole and bar openings are
next drilled, and the latter finished by
filing. It is better to plane up a short
piece of hard wood, ¹⁄₄ by ¹³⁄₁₆ in., and<span class="pagenum" id="Page167">[167]</span>
use it as a gauge in filing the rectangular
openings than to try to make
them by measurement. Polish the
brass pieces with a piece of fine emery
cloth or paper, rubbing it in straight
lines lengthwise of the stock.</p>

<p>The bending is done by clamping the
pieces in a vise and bending first one
side and then the other on the lines
indicated. This will require some care,
as the upper ends should be 1¹⁄₄ in.
apart on the inside when the bending is
complete. To insure the same angle
on both sides, a template of wood is
used, and the pieces are carefully bent
to fit it.</p>

<p>The holes for the points are reamed
tapering from the inside, where they are
riveted in place. The points are filed
to shape and polished, which is best
accomplished in a lathe. Clamp one of
the points in an upright position in a
vise with the shouldered end up. Slip
one of the brass pieces in place and
rivet by upsetting the projecting end
with a light hammer.—Contributed by

<p>The effect of this trick is not new, but
the method is a new one. A card is selected
by a spectator and noted, then
returned to the pack, which is shuffled
by the one drawing the card. Despite
the thorough mixing the correct card is
located by cutting the pack. The secret
is this: When the card is chosen, the
chooser is allowed to remove it from
the pack. The performer then takes it
and holds it up and asks the audience
to fix it in their minds. While doing
this, allow the thumb nail of the index
finger to slightly graze the edge of the
card. This will not show, nor can it be
detected by the holder, and he suspects
nothing of the kind. When returned to
the deck and shuffled the pack is evened
up for cutting. A glance at the edges
will show a small white spot distinctly,
as the scraped edge will contrast with
the other soiled cards. It is simple to
cut the pack from this key.—Contributed

<h2 class="nobreak">How to Use the Lawn Mower</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Difficulty in the operation of a lawn
mower is often caused by failure to
use the machine properly. A lawn
mower cuts like scissors except that
one of the members is fixed. The cutters
pass over the cutting bar at an
angle and thus shear off the grass. The
machine tends to throw the grass off
to one side, usually toward the left;
hence the machine should not be permitted
to throw the cut grass back into
the uncut patch. This may be prevented
by passing around the lawn so
that the uncut grass is at the right of
the operator.—W. H. Kruse, Fort
Wayne, Ind.</p>

<p>Campers desiring a sure supply of
angleworms for fishing will find the

and practical. A box, about
18 in. long and 10 in. square on the end,
is sunk into the ground in a shady

on their arrival is placed into it.
The soil used to fill the box should be
rich, black loam, quite moist but not
wet enough to be sticky. A few inches
of the top of the box is left unfilled and
a double layer of green sod is fitted
over it, as shown in the sectional view
at the right. The upper sod is arranged
level with the surface of the
ground and should be cut carefully so
that it will not be observed by
prowlers. If the region where fishing
is to be done is such that angleworms
cannot be obtained easily, it is best to
dig them before starting for the camp.
The bait cache may then be made as a
convenient place in which to keep the
bait in good condition for fishing.</p>

<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> E. R. HENDERSON</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">A</span><span class="afterlargecap a">mple</span> power for driving light machines
in a repair shop was obtained
by the use of a wind motor like
that shown in the <a href="#Fig172">sketch</a> and in the <a href="#Fig173">detail
drawings</a>. The device has numerous
other applications, particularly as a
substitute for wind motors that require
a high tower, as in the driving of a
pump. As an interesting and inexpensive
means of providing power for a
home or boy’s workshop, or as an
experimental
device, the
motor is also
worth while
making. The
materials used
are easily obtainable,
and
the construction
can be
carried out
with ordinary
tools, for the
most part.
The driving
connections
may be obtained
from
old machine
parts. The
dimensions
given are for
a motor of
considerable
size, and may,
of course, be
reduced proportionately
for a lighter
machine. If
the device is
made by boys,
the framework
and
other parts should be made one-half
as large as the sizes indicated. The
wood used should then be three-fourths
as thick as that shown. The roof of
the structure upon which the device is
mounted must be well braced and
strong enough to stand the strain. The
sails are headed toward the wind, like
those on a sailboat, when the motor is
at rest, by means of a control rod, F,
shown in the working drawing.</p>

<p class="caption">The Novel Wind Motor Developed Power for the Driving of

</div><!--container-->

<p>The main structural portion is a vertical
beam, or tower, tapered at the ends
and built up of 1 by 1-in. rods, strongly
braced, especially in the lower portion,
as <a href="#Fig173">indicated</a>. It is 14 ft. high, and built
around an 18-in. square board, A,
notched at the corners to receive the
posts. A similar 14-in. square, B, is
built into the
lower portion.
The lower end
of the tower is
pivoted on the
ridge of the
roof on a hollow
shaft
made from a
section of iron
pipe, D, and
provided with
a metal bearing
washer, E.
The pipe D is
split at its
upper end, as
shown in detail,
and fastened
to the
wooden plate
B. The control
rod F
passes up
through the
pipe D, and is
fixed to the
control wires,
reaching the
sails, by means
of a leather
strap, from
which an iron
swivel, C, is
suspended, as shown in the detail at
the left. The ends of the strap pass
over pulleys, fixed to the lower side of
the plate A, and connect with the sail-control
wires. Spiral wire springs are
attached to the wire connected to each
end of the strap, as shown only at the
right sail beam, and aid in controlling<span class="pagenum" id="Page173">[173]</span>
the sails. These springs are adjusted
so that when the control rod is drawn
down to its lowest extent, the sails will
be with the edge “into the wind,” thus
neutralizing each other, and causing
the sail beam to be at rest.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The sail beam extends 9 ft. out from
the center of the tower, and is built
up of three pieces. The center section
extends through the tower, above the
plate A, and the brace beam, which
crosses it at right angles, as shown in
the perspective sketch, and also at the
detail of the strap arrangement. The
center section is of 1 by 4-in. stock,

stuff, fastened securely, as shown at
detail G. The sails are supported on
masts, 1 in. square, pivoted at their
junctions with the sail beam, as shown
at detail G, and in guy-wire plates at
their extreme ends, as shown at detail
J. The fastening and bracing of the
gaffs at the mast ends is also shown
at J.</p>

<p>The canvas sails are 4 by 4 ft., and
mounted on the booms, gaffs, and
masts. The ends of the booms nearest
the masts are weighted with lead, as
shown at detail G, and extend beyond
the masts. The outer ends of the
booms are joined in pairs, and connect
to the spring and strap control. The
guy wires N, of No. 18 wire, supporting
the masts are fixed to the ends of
the sail beam and to the ends of the
brace beam, as shown in the sketch and
the working drawing. The fastening
at the ends of the sail beam is made
as shown at detail H, which also shows<span class="pagenum" id="Page174">[174]</span>
one of the coil springs. All of the
braces for the masts should be fitted
carefully, so as to have the proper tension
without interfering with the
action of the sails, before the tower is
set into its place. The device should
be tested on the ground, with the pivot
shaft set in a suitable support, before
attempting to mount it on a roof, or
other structure. The support for the
bearing should be fitted into the roof,
as shown. The power from the shaft
is transmitted to the bevel gears, and
from them to the drive shaft and the
belted pulley.</p>

<p>The main tower is supported on the
roof by means of strong guy wires, set
over four built-up guy towers of 1 by
1-in. wood, and 12 ft. long, as shown in
detail L. The towers must be set so
that the sail beam has proper play
and be secured firmly to the roof.
The top of the main tower is fixed to
the guy wires by means of a guy plate
shown in detail K. A plan of the
arrangement of the sail beam, brace
beam, and sail booms is shown at detail
M. The sail beam is braced by No. 12
guy wires, O, attached at the top of
the main tower, at the junction of the
two sections of the beam, and similarly
at the bottom of the main tower. The
fastenings of the wires and braces
should be made carefully, and they
should be examined thoroughly both
before and after the device is mounted
in place. Grease the pivoted and other
moving parts, and start the device
slowly, bringing the sails into the wind
as required for the desired speed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Repairing Wood-Wind Instruments</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Wood-wind instruments sometimes
“leak” at the joints or keys and make
playing of the instrument difficult.
Many such instruments are made in
sections, with ends that telescope to
form a tight fit. This fit is maintained
by the use of a cork band cemented
around the tenon end of the telescoping
joint. The renewal of these cork joints,
and the addition of new pads on the
keys, will make an old instrument
nearly as good as it was when new, so
far as playing is concerned, provided
the work is correctly done and the
wood of the sections themselves has not
cracked. Many musicians have spare
time and can do this work themselves.
The outlay for materials for the job is
from 75 cents to $1.00. A small alcohol,
or even a kerosene, lamp and an old
knife, or old file, are required.</p>

<div class="container w45emmax">

<img src="images/illo179a.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">The Cork is Fitted Carefully into Place,
and Glued</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>All traces of the old cork on the joint
can be removed with sandpaper, leaving
it as shown at the left. The cork
comes in strips of about the proper
thickness, and wide and long enough to
allow for trimming. The ends of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page175">[175]</span>
strip should be beveled to make a ¹⁄₄-in.
lap joint.</p>

<p>A small quantity of the cement is
heated over the lamp and six drops
poured on the joint; then with the end
of the file, which should be heated also,
it is spread to give an even, thin coating.
The beveled ends of the strip are
similarly treated. By working quickly
and carefully, the coating on the joint
and strip are brought to a plastic state
by holding in the flame, and the strip is
quickly laid in place. Before the cement
has time to harden, press the cork
in, forming a neat joint. Bind a rag
around the cork, leaving it until the
cement is thoroughly set.</p>

<p>The corked joint will be too large to
go into the joining section of the instrument.
File and sandpaper it to a
twisting fit. Though the cork should
be truly cylindrical, it may be tapered
a trifle smaller at the forward end. A
coating of tallow applied to the joint
will make it easy-fitting, but air-tight
and moisture-proof.</p>

<p>The pads are disks of felt incased in
thin sheepskin. After long usage, they
become too hard to make an air-tight
fit. Repadding should, therefore, be anticipated.
Shellac will give good results
in putting on pads. It is heated until
liquid and poured into the key recess.
The new pad is pressed into the liquid
shellac, care being taken to have it well
centered. For different keys, it will be
necessary to use varying quantities of
shellac to make the pad sit higher or
lower, as required.—Donald A. Hampson,
Middletown, N. Y.</p>

Cut deep slits in each end of these
pieces. Insert the end of the rubber

<p>Assuming that a contour map is to

of the original map, ordinarily section
lines or the boundaries of quarter sections,
are drawn on the larger sheet as
a base for the reproduction. Place the
device on the original map, as indicated,
the edge of the rubber band
touching a “horizontal” section line between
two “vertical” ones, the rubber
band under slight tension. On the
black surface of the band, dot white
points, with water color, along the section
line at which the contour lines
intersect it. Also place a dot at each
end of the band to indicate the position
of the two “vertical” section lines between
which the band is set.</p>

<p>Transfer the device to the same relative
position on the enlargement,
stretching the rubber band. Make dots
at each end, denoting the “vertical”
section lines, for the corresponding
lines on the enlargement. The series
of intermediate points along the band
will be in the same relative position
on the enlargement as they were on
the original. They can be connected
on the enlargement with as accurate a
result as obtained by the use of proportional
dividers, and more rapidly.</p>

<p>After the points are indicated upon
the enlargement, the reproducing device
is removed and the surface of the
rubber band cleaned instantly by
touching it with a moist cloth. The
exposed part of the rubber band is a
variable, and the device can be made
with this dimension adapted to the
work. It is capable of enlarging or
reducing at a ratio not greater than
six to one, above which the rubber
band approaches its elastic limit.—H.

<h2 class="lrgr nobreak">A Circular Swing<br>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> DAVIS FOSS GETCHELL</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">W</span><span class="afterlargecap">hile</span> on the farm I constructed
a circular swing which proved
very attractive to my boys and their
friends. By its side, and suspended
from the same tree branch, was an ordinary
swing. During the eight weeks
of our stay the latter was seldom in
use. The circular swing was a far
greater favorite with
all the young people,
boys and girls alike.</p>

<p>Around a branch
of a large elm and 18
or 20 ft. from the tree
trunk was looped a
10-ft. length of chain
and to the hanging
end of this was made
fast a 1-in. rope
nearly 10 ft. longer
than was needed to
reach the ground.
Directly beneath the
point where the
chain went around
the limb, as determined
by a plumb
bob, was set a 6-in. piece of cedar post
3¹⁄₂ ft. into the ground. This was
sawed off square 2¹⁄₂ ft. above the
ground. Into the top of this post was
set a ¹⁄₂-in. rod, to serve as a pivot for
the swing. It was set in firmly about
6 in. and projected about 3 in. from
the top of the post.</p>

<div class="container w40emmax">

<img src="images/illo181.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">The Circular Swing will be Found Very Safe and Pleasurable, but, as is the Case of an Ordinary Swing,
Anyone Careless Enough to Get in the Way of It will Get Badly Bumped</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page178">[178]</span></p>

<p>A straight-grained piece of pine
board, 15 ft. long, 8 in. wide, and 1 in.
thick, was procured and a hole bored
in one end large enough to make it
turn freely on the pin in the upper end
of the post. Two holes were bored in
the other end of the board large enough
to admit the rope. The first hole was
6 in. from the end, and the second hole,
3 ft. The hanging end of the rope was
passed down through one of these
holes and back up through the other
and then made fast to itself about 3
ft. above the board after the board had
been adjusted so that it would swing
throughout its length at the height of
the post, or 2¹⁄₂ ft. from the ground.
The swing was then complete except
for a swivel, which was put in the rope
within easy reach of one standing on
the board, so that it could be oiled.</p>

<p>One good push would send the board
with a boy on the end three or four
times about the 90-ft. circle. The little
fellows would like to get hold of the
board in near the post and shove it
around. Once started, it could be kept
going with very little effort.</p>

<p>In putting up such a swing, make
sure to have the post set solidly in the
ground, as it has a tendency to work
loose. Tie all the knots tightly. Do
not look upon the swivel as unnecessary.
The first swing I put up was
without one, and the rope twisted off
in a few days.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to climb a tree;
just throw a stout cord over the limb
by means of a stone or nut tied to the
end, then haul the rope and chain up
over the limb with the cord. Before
the chain leaves the ground loop the
end of it and pass the cord through the
loop. The higher the limb from the
ground the better the swing will work,
but 25 ft. will be about right.</p>

They are fitted with forked
tops, at A and B, and pulley wheels, C
and D. A wire, F, is fastened to two of
the prongs, at E, and a black thread, G,
runs over the pulley wheels. A carriage,
I, is formed from a 12-in. length
of stiff wire, and weighted, at L, to
balance upon the tight wire. The figure
K is cut from stiff paper, and made to
turn upon the carriage upright J, and
braced with thread, at H. Thus the

sled for use on it, that were built by a
group of young men at a summer resort.
While the slide shown is perhaps more
extensive than most boys would care
to undertake, the principle involved
may be adapted easily to others one-fourth
as long, less than 20 ft. The
slide shown was strongly built of 2 by
4-in. material for the framework, 2 by
6-in. planks for the slide guides, and
2 by 12-in. planks for the bearing for
the roller. Lighter material may be
used for the guides and the roller bearing
on a smaller slide, but the framework
should be of 2 by 4-in. stock.</p>

Toboggan and Slide. It may be Adapted to a Smaller
Size and Built by Boys. The Details of the Toboggan
and the Construction of the Slide are Shown in
the Sketches Above</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The high end of the slide illustrated
is about 7 ft. from the ground, but a
proportionately greater incline is provided
because the beach slopes gradually
to the water’s edge. It is reached
by a ladder fixed to a tree, which acts
as an end brace for the slide. If no
such natural support is available, the
end of the slide must be strongly
braced on three sides, to insure safety.
It is inadvisable to build the slide unduly
high to provide the necessary incline
since this may result in accidents.
A location where the ground
is suitable should be selected rather
than assume danger or risk.</p>

<p>The end of the slide nearest the
water may be given a slight upward
turn, so that when the toboggan leaves
it the rider is carried upward before
striking the water. The hold on the
toboggan should be retained when entering
the water, as injury may result
by failure to clear it in the plunge.<span class="pagenum" id="Page184">[184]</span>
With experience a dive may be made
as the toboggan leaves the slide.</p>

<p>The construction of the slide is
shown in detail in the lower sketch.
The framework of 2 by 4-in. material
should be only slightly wider than the
guides, and the supports should be
spread toward the ground to give rigidity.
The supports A should be
nailed firmly, or bolted, to the horizontal
members B. If lighter stock is
used, the pieces at B should be nailed
in pairs, one on each side of the uprights.
The guides C and D should be
of smooth lumber, and the edges of
these pieces, as well as of the bearing
plank E, should be rounded off to remove
splinters. The joints in the sections
of the guides should be made
carefully and placed over the framework
supports. They should be reinforced
from the lower side by plates of
wood.</p>

<p>The bearing plank E is of 2-in. stock
and 12 in. wide. It may be made of
lighter material in a smaller slide. The
joints in it should likewise be made
carefully, to insure smooth riding over
them. They should be set directly over
the framework supports, but not on
those over which joints have been made
in the guides. The plank forming the
bearing for the roller should not extend
to the end of the slide at the lower
end, but should be set back about 18
in. This permits the toboggan to slide
off smoothly rather than to spring directly
into the air from the bearing on
the rollers. The bearing plank may be
nailed into place, but care must be
taken to set all nails below the surface.
A better construction is to use screws
or bolts. Bore holes for them through
the plank, countersinking their heads.</p>

<p>The toboggan, as shown in the detail
sketches, is built strongly, and is
to be fitted over the 12-in. bearing
plank, allowing ¹⁄₄-in. play on each side.
The sides are of 1¹⁄₄-in. stock and high
enough to accommodate the rollers,
which should be about 3 in. in diameter.
The dimensions of 15 in. in width
and 30 in. in length, on the top surface,
are suggestive only, and will vary
with the materials used. The toboggan
will not stand the necessarily hard
wear unless good-quality oak, or other
hard wood, is used. The top and foot
brace should be fixed strongly with
screws, their heads countersunk.</p>

<p>The rollers are fixed in the sides by
means of screws, or a bolt may be set
through the length of the roller. In
either case the bearing should be in
holes bored through the sidepieces.
Washers should be fitted at the sides
of the bearings, and the latter must be
kept greased. All the edges and corners
of the toboggan should be rounded
off so that there is little possibility of
injury from slivers or contact with the
edges.</p>

<h2 class="lrgr nobreak">A Woodsman’s Log Raft<br>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> A. M. PARKER</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">M</span><span class="afterlargecap">aking</span> a raft for crossing a
stream, or other small body of
water, is often a diversion for campers,
who have the usual supply of camp
tools and materials. The woodsman
is sometimes confronted with a different
situation: He has only a hand ax
as his tool equipment, and to construct
a fairly safe raft of crude materials
becomes necessary in order to pursue
his course. Logs are readily available,
and he may be fortunate enough to find
willow withes, various stringy kinds of
bark, or even coarse seaweed. If these
are not available, the practical woodsman,
particularly of the northern regions,
builds a raft of logs, pinned together
firmly with poles and pointed
wooden spikes, cut on the spot. The
method, as shown in the illustration,
is simple and interesting. It may be
of service in the woods even when
other methods of binding the logs into
a raft are possible, and as a practical
test of woodcraft for the amateur or
boy camper it is of interest. The
sketch shows the completed raft, bound
together by wooden pins notched into<span class="pagenum" id="Page186">[186]</span>
poles, and the inset details show the
manner in which the poles are clamped
by the crossed pins.</p>

<div class="container w45emmax">

<img src="images/illo189b.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">The Inventive Woodsman Builds His Log Raft of Simple Materials Gathered at the River Bank; the Logs
and Poles are Notched Together Firmly and Held with Wooden Pins</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>This method of construction may be
applied to a variety of rafts, for carrying
small or large loads. In selecting
the material for the raft several
points must be considered. Dry logs
are preferable to wet or green ones,
and if the latter are used, a relatively
larger raft will be needed to carry a
certain load. For one passenger, three
logs, 9 to 12 in. in diameter, 12 to 16
ft. long, and spaced to a width of 5 ft.,
will provide a stable raft. Poles may
be laid across it to give sufficient footing.
For heavier loads the logs should
be about the same length and diameter,
but spaced closer together, and laid to
form a raft of considerable width and
of greater buoyancy.</p>

<p>Select a shore, sloping gently into
the water, if possible, and cut the
logs and poles as near this place as is
convenient. Cut the logs and roll,
them to the bank, alternating the butts,
if there is any considerable difference
in the diameter of the ends. Cut a supply
of poles of about 3-in. diameter,
and of the length necessary to reach
across the proposed raft. Then cut a
number of pins of hard wood, 1 ft. long,
and sharpened on one end, as shown in
the detailed sketch.</p>

<p>Roll the first log—one of the largest—into
the water until it is nearly floating.
If it is bowed or crooked, place
the “humped” side toward the outer
edge of the raft. Chop notches, 2 in.
deep, in the top of the log about 1¹⁄₂
ft. from the ends, and squarely across.
Place a pole in the notch, with its end
projecting slightly beyond the log, and
cut a double notch in the upper edge
of the pole, as shown in the detail
sketches, so that when the pins are
driven into the log, they will rest
diagonally in the notches cut into the
poles. Make rifts in the log with the
ax, cutting as though to split off a slab
of bark and wood, rather than toward
the center of the log, and drive two of
the pins into place. Properly done,
this will make a remarkably strong
joint. Fasten a second pole at the
other end of the log, and prop up both
poles so as to permit the next log to
be rolled into the water, under the
poles.</p>

<p>Notch the second log before slipping
it finally into place. Alternate ends
only, of the inner logs, need be fastened,
and if time is important, some
of the logs may be left unfastened,
provided they are held tightly between
the logs that are pinned. Shove the
raft out into the water as each log is
added. If there is a strong current it
is desirable to guy the raft with a
pole to the bank, downstream. The
last log, which should also be a large
one, is then floated down and pinned at
both ends.</p>

<p>The raft may then be floated, and is
ready to be covered with light poles or
brush, to provide a dry footing and a
place for the dunnage. The dunnage
is placed near the forward end of the
raft, and the person controlling it
sculls with a pole at the rear.</p>

the outer portions were usually
blurred, and vice versa. Compromising
between the two gave unsatisfactory
results. By providing a curved

are satisfactory except for architectural
subjects. A wooden box was
made as long as the desired print and
1 in. wider. The height may be made
as is convenient, but a height of about
2 in. is satisfactory. A partition was
fitted into the box, dividing its length
into two compartments. The upper
edges of the center partition and the
ends of the box were cut in the shape
of an arc, the curve being determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page187">[187]</span>
by the distance from the lens to the
easel when the center of the picture is
in focus. The bromide paper is fitted
to the curves on the box. The device
is fitted to the easel by means of two
strips fixed to the bottom of the box,
and extending beyond its ends. The
curved surface may be covered with
cardboard to give a better backing for

and formed into a dish shape, the surface
on which the onlaying is to be done
being covered with only a thin layer
of the wax. With a needle or other
suitable instrument, scratch the markings
desired through the thin layer of
wax to the surface of the cup. Pour
copper sulphate into the wax cavity
if the onlay is to be of copper, and suspend
a small piece of pure copper in
the liquid, connected with the positive
pole of a storage battery, or other similar
electrical source. Attach a wire
from the negative pole of the battery
to the cup. The copper will be deposited
on the surface of the cup where the
thin layer of wax has been scratched
off, exposing the metal. The thickness
of the deposit will depend on the length
of time that the current is permitted
to flow. Ten hours of action will permit
the depositing of a satisfactory
onlay.—M. H. Edwards.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Economy in Motorcycle Tires</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Caution in the use of motorcycle
tires with a minimum of abuse will
result in a considerable tire saving.
Tremendous wear on a single spot results
when the power is thrown in so
suddenly that the driving wheel makes
several revolutions before gripping the
ground. The proper air pressure must
be maintained in the tires in order to
obtain good wear. Guessing is a poor
method of determining the air pressure
and the exact condition should be noted
from time to time with a gauge. Ordinarily,
a pressure of 45 to 50 lb
should be maintained in the rear tire
and about 20 per cent less in the front
tire, in the case of 3-in. tires. Rim
cutting from running motorcycle tires
underinflated is the commonest abuse.
Dents in the edge of the rims cause
undue wear on the tire, the fabric being
worn through by the constant rubbing.
Bent rims are often caused by
insufficient air pressure in tires, the
liability to injury being increased
when crossing tracks or bumps with
an improperly inflated tire.</p>

<h2 class="lrgr nobreak">A Knock-Down Tennis-Court Backstop<br>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> EDWARD R. SMITH</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">S</span><span class="afterlargecap">evere</span> weather soon damages a
tennis-court backstop that is built
on posts set in the ground, and permitted
to remain in place during the
winter. The backstop shown in the
illustration was designed to overcome
this objection, and proved efficient on
this score, as well as economical to
build and maintain. Instead of setting
the supports in the ground, they are
set on the ground, and guyed by a
system of wire
braces. The wire
netting is also
held taut by wire
braces, and the entire
rigging is
quickly taken
down for storage,
and easily set up
when needed
again. The lower
edge of the wire
is held down by
hooks pinned to
the ground with
tent stakes, making
it convenient
to unhook the netting
when the
grass is to be cut
around the backstop.
The towers
are 50 ft. apart,
about 14 ft. high,
and built up of 4
by 4-in. and 2 by
4-in. pieces of
sound yellow-pine timber.</p>

<div class="container w35emmax">

<img src="images/illo193b.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">The Backstop is Taken Down between Seasons,
and can be Raised Quickly by Means of
the Supporting Cables</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Foundations of brick, anchored into
the ground, were made for the towers.
End braces of heavy wire, fastened to
the top, and guyed to the sunken
anchors at the ground, support the
towers against the weight of the netting
and wire rigging. This is convenient
in setting up the arrangement,
as a ladder can be leaned against
the end of the tower, guyed securely.
To withstand side motion at the top
edge of the netting, the supporting
wires are carried on crossarms of 1 by
1-in. pieces of wood, 2 ft. long. This
rigging is suspended between the
towers and wired
to the netting.
When this is
drawn up tightly,
the netting is
fairly taut. Additional
supporting
wires, with
vertical leaders to
the netting, are
used to draw up
the entire length
of the netting
tautly, as desired.</p>

<p>The netting extends
under the
towers, and is
supported there
by wires. As the
netting extends
nearly to the end
guy wires, players
cannot be harmed
easily by running
into the wires
particularly if a
white flag is attached
to the guy wires, about 6 ft.
from the ground. Number 20 gauge
wire was used for the supporting
cables, and No. 9 for the end braces
extending to the anchored fastenings.</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">A</span><span class="afterlargecap a">s</span> an example of the application of
steam power to the propulsion of
a vehicle, the motorcycle shown in the
illustration is interesting. While it
does not embody the many refinements
of gasoline motorcycles manufactured
commercially, and makes no pretense
of competing with them, the machine
has a striking individuality. It was
made by a mechanic in his spare time,
with only the facilities of a small machine
shop. Tests and hard usage over
typical roads have shown it to be easy
riding, partly by reason of its weight,
and to give very steady power. The
machine can be reversed quickly and
no clutch is used. It has a wheel base
of 75 in., and weighs about 350 pounds.</p>

<p>The upper portions of the frame are
made of 1-in. steel tubing, strongly
riveted at the fork and other joints.
The lower section, from the fork to the
rear axle, is made of a double bar of
1¹⁄₂ by ¹⁄₂-in. steel, spread and braced
to carry the tank, engine, and boiler.
The fork is forged from strips of steel,
and fitted to standard motorcycle
wheels. The handlebars, seat, transmission
chains and gears, as well as
other fittings, are of the ordinary
motorcycle type. The seat may be
moved and clamped at various places
along the upper bar of the frame, and
an extra seat may be installed, or a
bundle carrier may be fitted behind the
driver.</p>

<p>Gasoline, with which to heat water
for the generation of steam, is carried
in the long round tank, hung below the
frame at the top. The water supply is
contained in the square flat tank under
the lower part of the frame. The engine
is supported on the frame immediately
above the water tank, and
drives a shaft, which is geared to the
rear wheel by a chain and sprocket.</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Living in rooms, in which it was necessary
to use the small living room as
a kitchen and dining room as well, the
storage of the cooking equipment became
a problem. It was unsightly in
the room when not in use, and there
was no convenient place in which to
store it out of sight. The kitchenette,
shown in the sketch, was made from
an old sideboard, and served the purpose
admirably, being useful also for
other needs.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The top was removed and hinged to
one end, the supports being removable,
for storing them in the cabinet.
The hinged top provided a support for
the dishes while cooking. The partition
between the top drawers was removed
and the fronts of the drawers fastened
in place with screws. The space thus
made available was lined with asbestos,
and a small gas stove was fitted into it.
The gas line was connected to the
stove and two pieces of asbestos sheeting
were hinged to fold under the cover
and to be leaned against the wall as a
protection while cooking. The top
could be hinged at the back to protect
the wall, or cut in two and the parts
hinged one at each end of the cabinet.
The lower drawers of the kitchenette
were fitted to hold the cooking materials
and equipment.</p>

<p>When the kitchenette is closed it is
useful as a stand or table, for dining,

four strips, 2 in. wide, and long enough
to fit the four sides of the box. Nail
the pieces of the box together, as
shown, nailing the sides over the end
pieces, and the top over the frame of
sides and ends. Pack chaff into the
box, and, after filling the jars with
sirup and covering their openings with<span class="pagenum" id="Page193">[193]</span>
muslin, pack the jars into the box so
that their openings will be level with
the bottom through which the holes
have been cut. Fasten the board, with
holes for the jars, into place with
screws, so that it may be removed
when it is desired to remove the jars
for refilling. Nail the 2-in. strips
around the lower edge of the box so
as to cover the joint between the box
and the hive. The feeder is then fitted
into place, the bees feeding from the
surface of the muslin. The chaff prevents
the sirup from congealing in cold
weather and so it is always available
for the bees. The use of this simple
device will prove economical and practical
in keeping bees over the winter,
assuring them a good food supply, with
little effort on the part of the keeper.—Gus

</div><!--container-->

<p>The trick is performed as follows:
A forced deck is prepared having 24
like cards, and the backs of the cards
are held to the spectators when a card
is selected. The frame is made of a
molding 2 in. wide, mitered at the corners,
and of the size indicated, the
opening being 6³⁄₈ by 7¹⁄₂ in. The general
views of the frame in normal position
and inverted are shown in Figs. 1
and 5. A pocket is cut in the lower
edge of the frame at the back, as shown
in detail in Fig. 2. A pane of glass is
fitted into the frame, and on the three
edges other than the one having a
pocket, strips of cardboard, ¹⁄₈ in. thick,
are glued, as a bearing for a second
piece of glass, as shown in Fig. 4. The
back of the frame is fitted with a cover
of thin wood, and a hinged door is
arranged in the center of the back, as
shown in Fig. 3.</p>

<p>A mat of black cardboard is fitted
into the frame to form a background
behind the card, Fig. 1. The pocket at
the bottom is filled with black sand—that
used by sign painters is satisfactory—and
the frame is ready to receive
the card for the performance of the
trick. One of the cards from the forced
deck is placed in the frame. By inverting
the latter the sand is caused to
run between the glass partitions, concealing
the card on the black mat behind
it. In this condition it is exhibited
to the spectators and then placed upon
the table. A handkerchief is thrown
over it. The pistol is one of the toy
variety and a cap is fired in it. In
picking up the frame the performer
turns it over, while removing the
handkerchief, so that the black sand
runs back into the pocket in the frame.—Harry

<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> L. N. ROBINSON</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">A</span> <span class="afterlargecap">child</span> in the “toddler” stage
should be provided with a safe
place in which to play without disturbing
the household routine of the busy
mother too frequently. The folding
wood-and-wire fence shown in the
<a href="#Fig195">illustration</a> meets this need in a practical
and inexpensive manner. It may
be used in the home or out of doors,
the fence being especially useful in the
latter case, since it protects the child,
and likewise the
lawn flowers,
which a youngster,
unguarded,
may injure. The
fence is 25 to 32
in. high, strong
enough to support
a grown person
sitting on the
edge of it, and
incloses an area of
about 4 by 6 ft.
This is ample for
the child, and the
folded fence is
thus not too bulky
to be transported
easily. The materials
cost less than
$3.50, including
hardware for the
making of the
fence, as shown in
the <a href="#Fig196">working drawings</a>.
The wood
used for the main
frames is ¹⁄₂ by 2 in., and they are covered
with wire mesh, the edges of which
are nailed under strips, on the outer
side of the frames. Care should be
taken to insure that none of the wire
strands is exposed, thus endangering
the child, or the clothes of passers-by.
The frames are hinged together, as
shown in the plan, and fold into compact
form. Two long and four short
frames are required. Cut the top and
bottom rails of the long frames 6 ft. in
length, and those of the shorter frames
and the stiles 25 in. The corner joints
are cross-lapped by cutting away one-half
the thickness of each strip, as
shown at A. The joints at the top and
bottom of the center
stile, or vertical
piece, are
made as shown at
B, and the joints
at the crossing of
the center stiles
and the cross
braces, as at C.
The braces only
are notched to fit
the stile. Each of
the joints is fastened
with flat-head
screws,
countersunk. The
ends of the braces
are cut to fit flush
into the corners of
the frames, and
are nailed in place.
This provides a
flat nailing surface
for the wire
mesh and the
strips that cover
its edges.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Before putting on the wire mesh, all
the exposed corners should be “broken”
slightly with sandpaper, the wood
wiped smooth, and finished with a coat
of shellac. The wood may, of course,
be left unfinished. In fixing the 1-in.<span class="pagenum" id="Page196">[196]</span>
wire mesh in place, fasten one end of
the piece squarely at the end of the
frame, nailing it with staples. Place a
strip of wood under each end of the
frame and bear down on the middle of
the frame, or weight it, to produce a
bowed effect. Then nail the other end
of the wire securely; on removing the
strips, the wire will be drawn taut.
Tack the edges down, and repeat this
process on the other frames. Next
nail the covering strips on the front
faces of the frames, mitering them at
the corners, as shown at A.</p>

<img src="images/illo200a.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">Join the Pieces with Well-Made Lap Joints, and

</div><!--container-->

<p>The frames are then joined by means
of hinges, as shown in the plan at A.
Care should be taken that they are set
so that the corners of the fence meet
squarely and evenly when it is opened.
Metal drawbolts should be fastened
horizontally, one on the top of each
folding joint between the end sections.
These will prevent the child from folding
the ends in, and possibly injuring
its fingers. The completed fence is
then given a final coat of shellac or varnish,
the galvanized wire being left
unfinished.</p>

The lower part of the tube should be
paraffined to make it water-tight. A
brass or copper rod is placed through
the binding posts B and C. The resistance
can be changed by sliding the rod
up or down. The tube is nearly filled

The rheostat should be fastened to a
wall, or other support, and may be used
to regulate the speed of small motors
and other electrical devices.—R. R.

Reflectors</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>In the lecture and classrooms of a
large university it was found that reflections
of the electric-light bulbs in
the glazed porcelain reflectors were
extremely annoying to the eyes of
students, and concentration of sight on
the blackboard was difficult. A number<span class="pagenum" id="Page197">[197]</span>
of tests were made, and the following
method proved successful, eliminating
the glare and the reflections.
Large sheets of white blotting paper
were cut to fit the inside of the reflectors,
and then glued to their surface.
The soft, somewhat rough surface
of the blotting paper diffused the
light, so that the glare was overcome.—C.

<p>Boys, and other amateurs, sometimes
have need of a vise when a commercial
article or one of standard type cannot
be had readily. The devices shown in
the illustration will give good service
and can be made of material easily
obtained. The vise shown in Fig. 1
was made of old machine parts, consisting
of a bolt and a wing nut. The
bolt A was flattened at one end and
bent at a right angle. A hole to fit it
was bored through the top of the bench
B, and the washer C and wing nut D
were put in place. The piece to be
gripped is clamped under the end A.
This device should be fitted near the
end and front edge of the bench.</p>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">T</span><span class="afterlargecap">he</span> possibilities for
practical use as
well as novelty for play
and experimental purposes make the
compensated aerial cableway, shown in
the illustrations, not only interesting
but also worthy of study. The arrangement
assembled in its simplest form
with two towers, in the <a href="#Fig199">page plate</a>,
shows how the weight of the car is
compensated, so that a fairly level
course on the track cable is provided.
The various positions of the load and
cables, showing the application of the
compensating principle, are indicated
in <a href="#Fig199">Figs. 1 to 5</a>, and a multiple system
is shown in <a href="#Fig199">Fig. 6</a>. The details of the
constructional parts are also shown.
The car may be driven by wind power,
as shown in <a href="#Fig200">Fig. 7</a>, or by a motor, as
in <a href="#Fig201">Fig. 8</a>, in addition to the simple
application of hand power suggested
in the page plate. Devices for automatically
reversing the course of the
cars both for the sail rigging and with
the use of electrical power, are shown
in Figs. 7 and 8. By their use it is
unnecessary to have an operator at
each end of the cableway. The constructional
features were worked out
first by experiments on models in a
shop, and then applied to a large rigging
spanning over 100 ft. between the
A-frames. The sketch in the page
plate was made from photographs of
this construction. Application of the
compensating principle to carrying and
transportation problems affords opportunity
for interesting engineering, in
spanning streams, cañons, or gulleys.</p>

<p>In most types of cableways a considerable
sag is allowed in the cable
supporting the car in addition to that
caused by its own weight. Even in
systems of practically constant cable
tension, in which the wire is stretched
by enormous weights, the loaded car
causes a sag in the track cable, and
ascends and descends an incline when
approaching and leaving a tower. The
aim in the compensated cableway is
to overcome this sag as much as possible,
and to offer a minimum
of resistance to the
car in its course.</p>

<p>The simple form of compensated
cableway shown in the <a href="#Fig199">page plate</a> is
made by setting up two A-frames, with
wire braces supporting them, and
mounting the track and traction cables
upon them. A light, flexible compensating
cable extends from one tower to
the other and is fitted to grooved pulley
wheels at the tops of the towers,
as shown in the detail at the right.
The ends of the cable are fixed to wire
hooks, from which the track cable is
suspended. The latter is anchored at
the ends of the wire braces supporting
the A-frames. In order to understand
the operation of the system it is desirable
that the course of a load be traced
in its various stages, as indicated in
the diagrams, Figs. 1 to 5. For
diagrammatic purposes the load is
shown passing from the west slope to
the east. As the load passes under the
first A-frame, as in Fig. 2, the track
cable is drawn down at that point;
the corresponding end of the compensating
cable is also drawn down, raising
the opposite end of the track cable,
and taking out most of the sag in the
center portion of the track cable. As
the load passes to the center position,
as shown in Fig. 3, the track cable resumes
a more nearly horizontal position.
When the second A-frame is
reached the load draws the corresponding
end of the compensating cable
down with the track cable, Fig. 4, and
the latter assumes its normal position
as the load reaches the end of the
course. It is evident from the diagrams
that the course of the load is
more nearly level than it would be
if the sagging of the track cable were
not counteracted.</p>

<p>For use with a multiple-frame system,
the cables are arranged in units
between supports, as shown in Fig. 6.
The compensating action is similar, the
tendency being to level the entire
course of the load. The weight of the
car and load only is compensated, and
since the weight of the cable will cause
a sag, the course cannot be level, but
may approach this condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page200">[200]</span></p>

<p>A model of the compensated cableway,
as shown in the <a href="#Fig199">page plate</a>, or on
a smaller scale, may be made by a boy
of fair mechanical skill. For experimental
purposes the detail may, of
course, be refined to a high grade of
workmanship, if desired. The size and
dimensions of the parts need not be
proportioned precisely as shown, but
may depend more or less upon the
materials available. The track cable
should be made of galvanized-iron
wire, the compensating cable of fishline,
and the towers of 1-in. stuff, the
width of the pieces making up the A-frames
being increased in proportion to
the height. Grooved pulley wheels, set
in housings fixed to the top of the A-frames,
carry the compensating cable.
These may be made of wood, built up
in three sections, to provide a flange on
each side of the cable groove. The
A-frames should be joined strongly at
the top, and braced to anchors, sunk
into the ground as shown. The hooks
from which the track cable is suspended
are made of heavy wire, bent
so as not to interfere with the H-frame
hanger supporting the car, and looped
around the cable.</p>

<p>Various types of hangers may be
devised to house the two pulley wheels
which ride on the track cable. A
simple H-frame hanger is shown in the
detail sketch in the <a href="#Fig199">page plate</a>. The
grooved pulley wheels are set on bolts,
and a heavy wire is bent and set
through the center block as a support
for the car. For experimental purposes,
or even for play, when it is not
desired to make a more elaborate car,
a wooden block or other object of sufficient
weight may be used as a load.
An interesting feature of the work,
especially for a boy, is to devise a
realistic coach model, as suggested in
the sketch. A wooden block forms the
base, and the roof and platforms are
made of sheet metal. The windows
and doors are painted on the metal.
The inventive boy may, of course,
build a car with a hollow metal or
wooden body, and weight it properly
to provide the necessary load.</p>

<p>The motive power is provided by
means of a cord, or traction cable, carried
around two large grooved pulleys,
mounted in supports fixed to the landing
stages at each end of the cableway.
They are made of wood, a suitable
groove being cut around the edge
with a saw, and smoothed with a small
round file, or sandpaper wrapped over
a round rod. The traction pulley is
turned by means of a crank, set on the
bolt which is used as an axle. The traction
cable must be drawn sufficiently
taut to provide the necessary pressure
on the grooved pulleys, or it will slip.
Rosin applied to the pulleys and the
cable will tend to prevent this.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>If the frames and other fittings have
been properly set up, the cableway will
support a sail car, shown in <a href="#Fig200">Fig. 7</a>, or
a two-cell electric car, driven by a
small motor, as shown in <a href="#Fig201">Fig. 8</a>. The
sailing-car arrangement is often feasible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page201">[201]</span>
since a stiff breeze is common
in gorges, cañons, narrow valleys, or
even in ravines where such a cableway
might be set up. The hanger is an H-frame
having the grooved pulleys
bolted in it, and further reinforced by
small blocks at the ends. A braced
frame, supporting a deck on which a
mast is set, is suspended from the
hanger by four curved wires, as shown
in the side view, Fig. 7. A sail with
boom and gaff is supported by the
mast. It is arranged to be shifted
around the mast, which is accomplished
automatically at the end of a run, or
“tack,” by means of the trigger device
shown in the top view. The sail is
controlled in relation to the wind much
as is the main sheet of a sailboat. The
car can be operated in this manner only
at right angles to the direction of the
wind, or nearly so. For play purposes,
a boy stationed at each end of the
cableway can shift the sail, but the
trigger device shown makes this unnecessary.
A rubber band is attached
to the boom, as indicated in the top
view, and a cord and wire are arranged
to engage a trigger. A stop for the
trigger is fixed to the A-frame so that
it is sprung when the car reaches the
end of the run. The rubber band reverses
the sail, the car having been set
on the cable originally so that the forward
end is in proper relation to the
wind.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The electric car is especially interesting
in that it provides self-contained
motive power by means of a battery of
dry cells, and a motor belted to the
hanger, as shown in <a href="#Fig201">Fig. 8</a>. The
hanger is of the H-frame type with
heavy blocks between the sidepieces
to provide for the small grooved
driving pulley set on the axle of one
of the larger pulleys. A wooden deck,
supported by four heavy wires set into
the center block of the hanger, carries
the motor, and the dry cells are fixed
under it. The motor is of the small
reversible battery type, and should be
provided with a reversing lever. This
will make it possible to reverse the car
when it reaches the end of its course.
The motor and cells should be disposed
so as to balance, tests being made for
this purpose before setting them in
place finally. A cord or small leather
belt connects the drive pulley of the
motor with the proper pulley on the
hanger. These pulleys should be in
line, and that on the hanger should be
five times the diameter of the one on
the motor shaft. The power is shut
off at the end of the course by a shut-off
switch which strikes a stop crank
attached to the A-frame. When the
reversing lever and stop are used, the
stop crank is unnecessary. A nonreversing
motor can be made to drive the
car in a reverse direction by removing
the belt from the motor pulley and replacing
it to make a figure-eight twist.</p>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">A</span><span class="afterlargecap">mong</span> the engines of war in action
on land, probably none has created
greater interest than the now
famous “fighting tank,” which, according
to reports, pours out missiles of
destruction on the enemy from armored
turrets, and crawls over trenches, shell
craters, and similar obstructions, like a
fabled giant creature of prehistoric
ages. The tank described in this
article, while not as deadly as those on
the battle fields of Europe, performs
remarkable feats of hurdling trenches,
and crawling over obstructions, large
in proportion to its size. The model,
as shown in the <a href="#Fig202">heading sketches</a>, is
full-armored, and has a striking resemblance
to these war monsters. The
turret is mounted with a magazine gun,
which fires 20 projectiles automatically,
as the tank makes its way over
the rough ground. The motive power
for the tractor bands is furnished by
linked rubber bands, stretched by a
winding drum and ratchet device, on
the rear axle, as shown in <a href="#Fig203">Fig. 1</a>. When
the ratchet is released, the rear axle
drives the fluted wheels on it, and they
in turn drive the tractor bands, as
shown in the side elevation, <a href="#Fig205">Fig. 6</a>.
The wire-wrapped flywheel conserves
the initial power of the rubber-band
motor, and makes its action more
nearly uniform.</p>

<p>The tank will run upward of 10 ft.
on the rubber-motor power, depending
on the size and number of the bands
used. The gun is fired by a spring
hammer, actuated by a rubber band.
The trigger device is shown in <a href="#Fig203">Fig. 1</a>.
The pulley A is belted, with cord, to
the front axle. Four pins on its inner
side successively engage the wire trigger,
drawing it out of the gun breech
B, and permitting another shell to drop
into place. As the pulley revolves, the
trigger is released, firing the projectile.
This process goes on until the motor
runs down, or the supply of shells is
exhausted.</p>

<p>The tank is guided by the pilot
wheel, shown in <a href="#Fig203">Fig. 1</a>. The sheet-metal
armor, with its turret, is fitted
over the mechanism, and can be removed
quickly. It bears on angles
bent up, as detailed in <a href="#Fig203">Fig. 2</a>, to fit on
the ends of the wooden center crosspiece
of the main frame, and is held by
removable pins at the ends of this
frame. While the rubber motor is
easy to make and install, the range of
the tank can be increased by using a
strong spring motor, the construction
otherwise being similar.</p>

<p>The construction is best begun by
making the wooden frame which supports
the armor. The perspective
sketch, <a href="#Fig203">Fig. 1</a>, used in connection with
the working and detailed drawings,
will aid in making the latter clear.
Make the frame C, as detailed in <a href="#Fig205">Figs.
5 and 6</a>, ³⁄₈ by 1³⁄₄ by 11 in. long, with
an opening cut in the center, 1 in.
wide, 1 in. from the rear, and 1¹⁄₄ in.
from the front end. Make the crosspiece
D ³⁄₈ by 1³⁄₄ by 5⁷⁄₈ in. long; the
gun support E, as detailed in <a href="#Fig203">Fig. 4</a>,
³⁄₈ by 1⁵⁄₁₆ by 6¹⁄₄ in. long. Shape the
support E as shown. Fasten the frame
C and the crosspiece D with screws,
setting the piece D 5³⁄₄ in. from the
front, and its left end 3 in. from the
side of the frame, as shown in Fig. 5.
This is important, as the fitting of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page203">[203]</span>
other parts depends on the position of
these wooden supports.</p>

<p>The drive-wheel axles are carried in
sheet-metal hangers, F, shown in <a href="#Fig203">Figs.
1</a> and <a href="#Fig205">5</a>, and detailed in <a href="#Fig205">Fig. 6</a>. These
hangers also carry bearing wheels, G,
Fig. 1, which are held between the
hanger F and a metal angle, as detailed
at G, Fig. 6. These wheels are cut
on a broomstick, and mounted on
nail axles. The metal for the hangers
F is drilled as shown, and bent double
at the ends to make a strong bearing
for the drive-wheel axles. The upper
portion is bent at a right angle and fits
over the top surface at the end of the
crosspiece D, and is fastened to it with
small screws or nails. Cut the stock
for the hangers 2 by 6³⁄₈ in. long.</p>

<p>Next make the sheet-metal support
H, <a href="#Fig203">Fig. 1</a>, for the flywheel, the rim of
which is wrapped with wire to give it
added weight. Cut the stock, as detailed
in <a href="#Fig205">Fig. 6</a>, 1³⁄₄ by 4³⁄₁₆ in. long,
and notch it to form the spring
arrangement, which holds the flywheel
so that the belt will be tight. The
other sheet-metal support may then be<span class="pagenum" id="Page204">[204]</span>
made also. Cut the stock for the front
support J, for the rubber motor, 4¹⁄₈ by
3³⁄₄ in. long, and shape it as shown in
the detail, Fig. 6. Make the support
K from a piece of sheet metal, in general
shape similar to that used for support
H, the dimensions being made as
required, and no spring arrangement
being provided. Drill these metal fittings,
as indicated, for the points of
fastening, and mark the places for the
holes in which shafts or axles run very
carefully.</p>

<p>The driving mechanism can then be
made, as shown in <a href="#Fig203">Fig. 1</a>, and detailed
in <a href="#Fig205">Figs. 5 and 6</a>. The driving shafts
and their parts, as well as the pulleys,
can be turned in a lathe, or made from
spools, round rods, etc. Make the front
axle L, and wheels, joined solidly, 5³⁄₄
in. over all, the grooved wheels being
³⁄₄ in. thick, and 1⁷⁄₁₆ in. in diameter.
Wires are used as bearings for shafts
for the driving axles. If the rear axle
is turned in a lathe, it is cut down to
the shape indicated, thinner at the
middle, to provide a place for the cord
connected to the rubber motor. The
grooved pulley and the fluted drive
wheel at the winding-key end, shown
in Fig. 5, are then cut loose; the drive
wheel on the other end is cut loose,
forming three sections, mounted on the
wire axle, one end of which is the winding
key. Ratchet wheels, M, are fitted
between the ends of the center section
and the adjoining pieces, the ratchet
wheels being nailed to the center section
and soldered to the wire axle.
Pawls, U, are fitted to the inside of
the two end sections, as indicated in
Fig. 1 and in Fig. 5. When the rubber
motor is wound up on the drum, the
tractor bands are gripped until it is
desired to start the tank on its trip.
Then the power is communicated from
the drum, or center section of the axle,
to the drive wheels by means of the
ratchet wheels, acting on the pawls.</p>

<p>Mount the hangers F on the center
crosspiece D, fitting the axles of the
drive wheels into place. Make the
weighted flywheel, and mount it on its
shaft, as shown, lining it up with the
pulley on the rear drive shaft. Fit the
supports J and K into place, setting
spools for the rubber-motor cord in
place, on wire axles. Arrange the belt
from the flywheel to the drive shaft,
and connect the rubber bands for the
rubber motor as shown. Fasten one
end in the hook of support J, and pass
the winding cord through the spools,
and fix it to the drive shaft. The device
can then be operated with the
fluted drive wheels, bearing on strips
of wood for tracks.</p>

<p>The tractor bands N are fitted over
the drive wheels, as shown in <a href="#Fig205">Fig. 6</a>.
They are built up of canvas strips, on
which wooden shoes are glued and
sewed, as detailed in <a href="#Fig205">Fig. 5</a>. The
stitches which reinforce the gluing are
taken in the order indicated by the
numerals. The pilot wheel is 2 in. in
diameter, and sharpened at its circumference.
Make a metal shell, O, for it,
as detailed in Fig. 6. Solder the shell
to the double wire, which supports the
wheel and gives it a spring tension to
take obstructions nicely. The wire is
fastened to the crosspiece D, as shown
in Fig. 5.</p>

<p>The gun and its mechanism can be
made handily before the support E is
fixed into place at the front of the
crosspiece D. Shape the magazine P
from sheet metal, making it 2⁵⁄₈ in.
high, as detailed in <a href="#Fig203">Fig. 4</a>. Make the
gun Q from a piece of sheet metal, as
detailed, cutting the metal to the exact
dimensions indicated. Mount the magazine
and the gun, and arrange the wire
hammer R, and the rubber band that
holds it. Fit the pulley A into place
on its axle, supported by a small block
of wood. Belt it to the front drive-wheel

armor together. The bottom extension
on the sidepieces is bent double to form
an angle, on which the armor is supported,
where it rests on the top of the
hangers F. The turret is fitted to the
deck by cutting notches along its lower
edge, the resulting strips being alternately
turned in and out along the
point of joining, as shown in Fig. 3.
When the armor is completed, it is
fitted over the main frame, the gun
projecting from the turret. Small pins
hold the ends of the armor solid against
the ends of the main frame C, so that
the armor can be lifted off readily. The
various parts of the fighting tank can
be painted as desired, care being taken
not to injure the points of bearing, on
the axles and pulleys, which should be
oiled. Silver bronze is a good finish
for the exterior of the armor, which
may be decorated with a coat of arms.</p>

<p class="caption">This Homemade Rheostat Has a Capacity of One-Half
to Five Amperes, on a Six-Volt Circuit</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>A rheostat made as shown in the
sketch has been used successfully for
calibrating a large number of ammeters
and wattmeters. One of the general
designs suggested will be useful for
many other purposes. The dimensions
given were used for obtaining a variation
of from ¹⁄₂ to 5 amperes with a
6-volt source of electromotive force.
For other capacities the proportions
may be increased or decreased proportionately.
A piece of pine, 7 by 9¹⁄₂
in., forms the base. For resistance
wire No. 16 gauge “Climax” was used,
but wire of any material which will
carry the maximum current without
excessive oxidation may be employed
instead. Nails support the resistance
wire, which should be soldered to the
nails to insure good electrical contact.
Leads of flexible cord are arranged as
shown. These are soldered to the first
and last nails in the series. To provide
connection between the free ends of
the cord and the resistance wire or the
nails, 5-ampere test clips are soldered
to the cord ends. The teeth of the clip
jaws are filed off, and in their stead
a short piece of brass wire is soldered
to each jaw, as indicated in the detailed
view. A nick is filed in each of the
brass wires so that they will hold firmly
onto the resistance wire or nail.
Suspender or display-case clips, suitably
modified, may be substituted for
the commercial test clips.</p>

<p>In using the device, one clip is moved
along the front span. The other is
gripped to a nail in the rear row. Sliding
the front clip along the span wire
insures a fine adjustment of resistance.
Gripping the rear clip on the different
nails provides the coarse adjustment—R.

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Typewriter paper may be fed from a
roll where only one copy is necessary
and where maximum speed of production
is essential. Sections, not to exceed
about 11 in. in length, of the typed
paper are torn off as necessary. This
practice is followed often in newspaper
offices. The roll paper can be purchased
at any paper-supply house, cut to
the width required by the user. The
construction of a roll-feed attachment
which may be mounted on any of the
standard typewriters will be described.</p>

<img src="images/illo211a.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">A Paper-Roll Holder for Typewriters That can be
Attached to Any Standard Machine</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>First make the two uprights. Both
are cut from ¹⁄₆-in. sheet brass, as
shown. After cutting, heat the pieces
to anneal them before bending. A
hole is provided for the paper-roll rod
in the right-hand upright and a slot in
the left-hand one. A rod, threaded on
one end and equipped with two nuts,
constitutes the paper holder. For
a guide plate and cutter, cut a piece of
sheet brass, 1¹⁄₂ in. wide and of a length
equal to that of the carriage, as detailed
in the drawing. Bend it as shown. A
¹⁄₈-in. slot is cut almost the entire
length of the guide.</p>

<p>In mounting the holder on the typewriter,
the uprights are drilled at the
base to engage the two small screws at
the side of the carriage back of the
roller. The exact location of these
holes will vary in machines of the different
makes. Next, the uprights are
clamped into place with the screws,
one at each end of the carriage. Then
determine the distance between the
arms of the uprights, drill a corresponding
hole at each end of the guide-and-cutter
plate, and fasten the plate
to the uprights with small stove bolts.
The roll of paper is placed on the rod
and fed between the machine platen
and roller as with single sheets. When
the article or memorandum being written
is finished, the paper is held against
the guide plate and the blade of a
pocketknife inserted in the slot. Passing
the blade the length of the slot cuts
off the paper, or it may be torn off at
the slot. The end of the paper roll is
again fed into the machine, ready for
another operation.</p>

<h2 class="lrgr nobreak">Improvised Post-Card Projector and Enlarging Camera<br>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> HARRY MARCELLE</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">A</span><span class="afterlargecap a">n</span> outfit which may be used for
either projecting picture post
cards or enlarging photographic negatives
was assembled as delineated in
the <a href="#Fig209">illustration</a>. An ordinary camera,
which provides the lens and bellows,
is required, in combination with a dark
box which can be built in the home
workshop. The method of construction
is this:</p>

<p>Make a box about 8 in. square out of
¹⁄₂-in. planed soft-wood stock. Nail
the sides, but omit, for the present,
the top and the bottom. The two
openings thus left will be called the
front and the back. Mount an 8 by
8 by ¹⁄₂-in. board, D, which constitutes
a door, on the back with
hinges and provide a hook to hold it
shut. Cut a square hole, of the same
size as that of the opening in the back
of the camera which is to be used, in
another 8 by 8-in. piece, E. This
will constitute the front board. This
front board is so cut that it fits in
between the sides of the box instead
of on the ends, as does the back. In
the top, cut a square hole for ventilation.
A hood is provided over this
hole to prevent light being thrown
forward.</p>

<p>When using the arrangement as a
projector or magic lantern two 40-watt
tungsten lamps, A, are required.
Each lamp is mounted in a porcelain
receptacle held on the floor with
screws. A lamp cord, one end connecting
the two lamps in multiple and
the other fitted with an attachment
plug, passes through a hole in the floor
of the box. Form the two reflectors,
B, of 8 by 7-in. bright tinned sheet-iron
pieces, each having holes along
one of its edges to admit of attachment.
The reflectors are bent to a
semicircular contour before mounting.
The card holder is detailed at C. It is
a piece of tinned sheet iron bent to
the form shown so that it will hold a
post card. A hole is drilled in its center
for a screw pivot. It can then be
fastened to the center of the back door
and can be turned into position for
either horizontal or vertical pictures.
A washer is inserted on the screw between
the holder and the door. The
thickness of the camera body having
been determined, a slide is fastened to
the front board, as diagrammed, to
support this body.</p>

<div class="container w35emmax" id="Fig209">

<img src="images/illo213.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">An Ordinary Small Camera, Fitted with This Attachment,
Becomes an Enlarging and Post-Card
Projecting Camera</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Before it can be used as a projector
it must be adjusted to operate with the
camera of the type and size available.
The adjustment, which must be made
in a darkened room, having on one of
its walls a white screen on which the
image will be projected, is effected
thus: Remove the back from the camera
and place the camera in the slide
without extending the bellows. Open
the shutter. Insert a card in the holder
C. Light the tungsten lamps. Now
move the front board, with the camera
carried on it, back and forth within the
box until the components are in focus,
that is, until the most distinct image
obtainable is reproduced on the screen.
Then, illuminate the previously darkened
room and nail the front board in
the position thus determined. These
adjustments having been made, paint
the box, inside and out, a coat of dead
black. Everything should be painted
black except the reflecting surfaces of
the tin reflectors and the incandescent-lamp
bulbs. The front board having
been fastened, subsequent focusing can
be effected by shifting longitudinally<span class="pagenum" id="Page210">[210]</span>
the lens board of the camera. The
image of any sort of a picture that will
fit in the holder can be reproduced.
Colored post cards will project in their
natural tints.</p>

<p>To make enlargements with the same
box, a few minor changes are necessary.
When employed for enlargements
the tungsten lamps, which are
required for projection, are not used.
They may, however, remain in the box
and can be disconnected from circuit
by unscrewing them a few turns. The
negative, or film, which is to be enlarged,
is held in the opening E. Where
a film is to be reproduced, it is held
between two pieces of glass which are
fastened to the inside of the front board
with small clips. If a glass negative is
used, the two additional glass plates
are unnecessary. If the negative does
not fill the opening in the camera, a
mask cut from heavy black paper will
be required to cut off the light.</p>

<p>The light for the enlargement is furnished
by another tungsten lamp
mounted in a porcelain receptacle
which is screwed to a board which constitutes
a base. This light source is
moved about in the house until it is
directly back of the opening E in the
front of the box and until the light is
distributed equally over the entire negative.
To focus, move the camera backward
or forward. While focusing, use
a yellow glass, or ray screen, to cover
the lens. When focusing has been completed,
the shutter is closed and the ray
screen removed. Then stop down the
lens to bring out detail, and expose.</p>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">A</span><span class="afterlargecap a">n</span> anemometer is an instrument
which measures the velocity of the
wind. The anemometers used by the
weather bureau consist of four hemispherical
cups mounted on the ends
of two horizontal rods which cross at
right angles and are supported on a

sides the device is caused to revolve
at a speed which is proportional,
approximately, to that of the wind.
The axle, to which the rotary motion is
transmitted from the cups, is connected
to a dial mounted at the foot of the
supporting column. This dial records
automatically the rotations. The reproduction

when mounted on a high building,
will indicate by the changing
rapidity of its revolutions only the
comparative, not the real, velocity of
the wind.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>In constructing the instrument,
straight, dished vanes will be used instead
of hollow cups. The vanes operate
almost as effectively and may be
combined more readily into a sturdy
rotating unit. A bicycle front hub is
utilized to constitute a wear- and noise-proof
bearing having minimum friction.
Each of the four wings is formed
from a piece of galvanized iron, measuring
4¹⁄₂ by 10 in., which has one end
cut to a curve as shown. To each wing
is fastened, with tinners’ rivets, a 4-in.
length of ³⁄₄ by ¹⁄₁₆-in. strap iron. Form
each of the strips into a trough-shaped
vane, measuring 2¹⁄₄ in. from edge to
edge—this being the distance between
the spoke flanges of a bicycle hub. Some
cylindrical object of suitable diameter
will serve as a form for bending. Place
the ends of the support strips between
the spoke flanges and rivet them securely.
The rivets pass through the spoke
holes. Some trying out may be required
to insure a symmetrical arrangement
of the parts. Solder the
curved end of each wing to the inner
surface of the adjacent wing. Place
a tin cap—a salve-box lid will do—under
the upper locknut on the hub to
exclude rain from the bearing.</p>

<p>The supporting upright may be a
heavy wooden rod, or a piece of iron
pipe. A yoke of 1 by ¹⁄₈-in. strap iron,
held to the top of the upright with
screws, is provided for the attachment
of the hub. The locknut on the hub
clamps it to the yoke. Apply a coat
of metal paint to the iron parts which
are exposed. Mount the device sufficiently
high to give the wind free access
to it from all directions. The
curve at one end of each wing is an irregular
one. Hence, its accurate construction
involves a knowledge of
sheet-metal pattern drawing. However,
if it is made of a form similar to
that shown it will fit sufficiently well
to permit a good soldered joint.</p>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">T</span><span class="afterlargecap">he</span> construction of small docks,
wharves, piers, and foundations
or bridges, buildings, and other structures,
by the driving of piling is interesting
out-of-door play, in which
boys will find much fun. A pile driver
for this work is shown in the page
plate, <a href="#Fig214">Fig. 1</a>. The hammer is raised
by means of a winch, and is dropped
automatically when it reaches the cap
of the derrick, as indicated in <a href="#Fig214">Fig. 3</a>.
The drum is then released, and the
weighted double-hook nipper drops
down, picking up the hammer on the
next upstroke. A single-hook nipper,
that can be made easily of wire, is also
shown in the detail sketch, <a href="#Fig216c">Fig. 6</a>. The
small boy who cannot make the nippers
or the winch, may tie the rope directly
to the hammer, drawing it up by
hand, and dropping it as desired. The
hammer need not be fitted to the
guides, but merely arranged to drop
between them, and the derrick can be
made of only a few main pieces. The
larger parts of the hammer and nipper
weight are best made of lead, babbitt,
or white metal, as these may be cut or
melted readily. Iron, brass, or copper,
solid or in plates, may be used, if
means for shaping them are at hand.</p>

<p>The making of the derrick may be
undertaken first. Make two pieces for
the bed A, ⁷⁄₈ by ⁷⁄₈ by 17 in.; two
hammer guides B, ⁷⁄₈ by ⁷⁄₈ by 33¹⁄₈
in.; one bed piece, C, ³⁄₈ by ⁷⁄₈ by 20
in.; two bed pieces, D, ³⁄₈ by ⁷⁄₈ by
5¹⁄₄ in.; two posts, E, ¹⁄₂ by ¹⁄₂ by
34¹⁄₂ in.; two braces, F, ³⁄₈ by ³⁄₄ by
26¹⁄₂ in. Cut these pieces slightly
over their finished lengths as given,
allowing for trimming and fitting.
Make strips, ¹⁄₄ by ¹⁄₂ in., for the bracing
on the sides of the derrick and the
ladder bracing on the back.</p>

<p>Notch the lower ends of guides B,
¹⁄₈ by ⁷⁄₈. and the lower ends of posts
E, on an angle, ¹⁄₈ in. deep, to fit pieces
A. Join the parts of the bed, as shown
in the <a href="#Fig214">page plate</a>, pieces A being set
3¹⁄₂ in. apart, fastening them with bolts
or screws. Make braces G, of sheet
metal, and bolt them in place. Fit the
posts E into place, and fasten them at
the bed and the top. Put on several
ladder braces temporarily, to steady
the frame. Fit the braces F carefully,
and bolt them in place. Remove
the piece C and the braces F, and nail
the horizontal bracing to the sides of
the frame. Then fit and nail the diagonal
braces. The bolted construction
is convenient in “knocking down”
the derrick for storing it. Reassemble
the parts, and make the cap for the
headblock.</p>

<p>The headblock and cap are shown in
detail in <a href="#Fig214">Figs. 2 and 3</a>. Make two
pieces, H, ¹⁄₄ by 1⁵⁄₁₆ by 1³⁄₄ in.; one
piece, J, ¹⁄₄ by 1 by 1³⁄₁₆ in.; two braces,
K, ¹⁄₄ by 1¹³⁄₃₂ by 1³⁄₄ in. Make the
two beveled pieces of the cap ⁷⁄₈ by
1³⁄₄ by 1¹⁄₂ in., and provide a wooden
strip or metal plate for the front and
rear edges, as shown. Fasten strips
of sheet metal to the bevel of the
notch, to protect it from wear by the
striking of the nipper hooks. Make
the sheave 1¹⁄₂ in. in diameter and ³⁄₈
in. thick, with a groove for the rope.
Assemble the parts, as shown.</p>

<p>The details of the winch are shown
in <a href="#Fig216a">Figs. 4</a> and <a href="#Fig216b">5</a>, and the method of
assembling the parts, in <a href="#Fig214">Fig. 1</a>. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page216">[216]</span>
drum may also be driven without
gears by fixing the crank directly to
the shaft. Gears may be obtained
from old machines, or purchased from
dealers in model supplies. Make the
supports L and M, Fig. 4, ³⁄₄ by 4 by
6⁵⁄₈ in., cutting patterns of paper, if
desired.</p>

sheet metal. The brace P is bent from
a ¹⁄₁₆ by ³⁄₄ by 1⁵⁄₈-in. strip of sheet
metal, and riveted to the pawl. Assemble
the parts, fastening the gear to
the drum end, and bolt the supports
into place. Put the pinion into mesh
with the gear at its proper place, and
carefully mark the hole for the crank.
Square the end of the crank and the
hole in the pinion, and fit them to a
driving fit. Fix the rope to the drum,
and reeve it through the head block.
The derrick is then ready for the hammer
and the weighted nipper.</p>

<p>The single-hook nipper, shown in
<a href="#Fig216c">Fig. 6</a>, is made as follows: Flatten a
piece of ³⁄₁₆-in. wire at the middle, and
drill a ³⁄₃₂-in. hole for the bolt. Shape
the lower end into a pointed hook, and
bend the upper end to form the trip
arm. This strikes the notch in the
cap of the derrick, releasing the hammer.
The rope is wired to the hook
as shown. The nipper weight is made
of a solid piece of lead, 1¹⁄₄ by 2⁵⁄₈ in.,
by 1 in. high, grooved at the ends to
fit the guides. Cut a slot through it,
for the hook, as shown in Fig. 6, and
bolt the latter into place. The double-hook<span class="pagenum" id="Page217">[217]</span>
nipper is better mechanically, and
may be made of two pieces of wire,
or cut from sheet metal.</p>

<p>Test the action of the nippers, and
bend or file the hooks to operate properly.
The pile driver may then be
painted, and work on “jobs” begun.
If it is used at the water, fix metal
guards at the lower ends of the guides,
to prevent the hammer from falling
into the water.</p>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">S</span><span class="afterlargecap">ubmarine</span> photography should
have great attractions for amateur
photographers who have access to
lakes, ponds, and other clear waters.
While more careful work is demanded
than in ordinary photography, the
method of obtaining good results is not
difficult, and the necessary equipment
may be provided by constructing the
device shown in the <a href="#Fig221">illustration</a>. Submarine
pictures can be taken in a considerable
depth of water, providing it
is reasonably free from foreign matter.
This is a fascinating field of photography,
and many pictures of educational
and scientific value remain to be
made of under-water life. The illustration
shows the detailed construction
of the camera chamber, and the method
of suspending it from a bridge, or other
place convenient to the body of water.
Reproduced in the <a href="#Fig221">oval panel</a> is a photograph
of fish near baited hooks, on a
fishline. The original was made from
a negative exposed by the use of the
camera chamber described.</p>

<p>The problem of making photographic
exposures under water involves the
provision of a strong water and pressure-proof
container for the camera, a
means for controlling the shutter, and
a suitable opening in the container
through which the exposures may be
made. The arrangement described
combines these features in a simple
manner, and by the use of materials
that can be obtained without difficulty.
It was made for a camera taking 4 by
5-in. pictures, and the dimensions
given are for a container for this size.
The dimensions may be varied to adapt
the device to various cameras, within
reasonable limits. A 9-in. steel pipe
was used for the chamber, and its ends
were fitted with pipe caps. A heavy
piece of plate glass was fitted into the
forward cap, which was cut into the
shape of a ring, to provide the exposure
opening. The general arrangement
of the camera in the chamber is
shown in the sectional view, <a href="#Fig221">Fig. 1</a>, as
seen from the shutter end. The electrical
device, by which the shutter is controlled,
is shown in this view, and in
<a href="#Fig221">Fig. 2</a> it is shown in detail.</p>

<p>The chamber was made as follows:
A section of 9-in. steel pipe was cut
to a length of 11¹⁄₂ in. and threaded on
the ends to fit pipe caps. The forward
pipe cap was chucked up in a lathe and
the center portion cut away, to provide
an exposure opening and a shoulder at
the rim, on which the plate-glass window
rests. A graphite paint was applied
to the rim, then the glass was
bedded solidly in it, and a rubber gasket
was fitted to the joint, making it waterproof
when the cap was drawn up
tightly. The chamber assembled and
in detail is shown in the <a href="#Fig221">illustration</a>.</p>

<p>Holes were bored into the top of the
chamber, and eyebolts were fitted into
them. Between the eyebolts a hole was
bored and fitted with a water-tight collar,
through which the wires leading
to the shutter-control device pass. The
chamber is supported by the wires,
which are fixed to the eyebolts and
secured at the base of operations by
the photographer.</p>

<p>A support for the camera was provided
by bending a strip of ¹⁄₈ by 1-in.
band iron to the shape indicated in <a href="#Fig221">Fig.
1</a>, at A, and riveting it to the bottom
of the chamber. Its upper surface is
flat and was bored and threaded to fit
the tripod thumbscrew B, on the lower
surface of the camera. The camera is
arranged on the support and clamped
into place firmly by the thumb nut, as
it might be on a tripod. The adjustment
of the camera in the chamber is
done from the rear, and the space beneath
the thumbscrew should be large
enough to make access easy. A camera
of the size indicated, when fitted with
its lens centering on the center of the
window, will be raised sufficiently for<span class="pagenum" id="Page220">[220]</span>
convenience in clamping it. The
threads on the back cap must fit snugly
and no paint must be used on them.
Hard oil, or vaseline, may be applied to
insure a water-tight joint that permits
easy removal of the cap.</p>

<p>The making and adjustment of the
electrical shutter device requires care,
but its operation is simple. An electromagnet,
of the type used on doorbells,
was fixed to the front of the camera,
above the shutter, as shown in <a href="#Fig221">Fig. 1</a>,
and in detail in <a href="#Fig221">Fig. 2</a>. It is actuated
by current from two dry cells. The
latter are kept in a convenient carrier
at the base of operations, and are connected
to the magnet by a single strand
of double, waterproof wire. This is
spread as it reaches the chamber and
fastened to the two eyebolts in the top.
The ends of the wires are conducted
through the water-tight center opening
between the eyebolts, and attached to
the magnet. The release lever is fitted
to a steel hook, pivoted at its upper end
with a small nail, C, Fig. 2. A rubber
band is fixed to the lower edge of the
shutter lever and its other end is attached
to the front of the camera.
When the current is permitted to flow
into the magnet by pressing a contact
key, in the hand of the operator, the
steel hook is drawn from the release
lever, and the rubber band draws the
lever down, making an exposure.</p>

<p>The double-wire cable carries the
current as well as holds the chamber
suspended in the water. The wire
should be about 25 ft. long, and, in
transporting the outfit, or when only
partly used, is coiled. The chamber
should be completed for picture-taking
operations by giving it a coat of dull,
black waterproof paint, both inside and
outside. This will prevent rusting and
also serves to make the object inconspicuous
when in the water. It is important
that the interior be painted in
this manner, because reflections of light
within the chamber may cause difficulty
in obtaining satisfactory results.
When the paint is thoroughly dry, the
device may be tested for leakage and
assembled ready for a test before making
an actual trial in the water. The
camera is fitted into the chamber so
that it centers on the center of the
plate-glass window, and is clamped into
place. If the electrical device operates
satisfactorily the plate may be inserted,
the plate-holder slide withdrawn, the
back cap replaced securely, and the
outfit lowered into the water. It should
be watched carefully until it reaches
the proper depth, for, if it is permitted
to touch the bottom, the sediment
stirred up must be given time to settle
before an exposure is made. The forward
end of the chamber should be
marked on its upper edge with a streak
of white paint, to aid in identifying it
at considerable depth in the water.
This is important, since the operator
must shift the chamber carefully until
the window faces the objects to be
photographed. When the chamber is
in position, the contact key is pressed
and the exposure is made.</p>

<p>The time of exposure for under-water
photography depends on the clearness
of the water, the depth at which the
pictures are to be taken, and the light
conditions on the surface. A bright
day is, of course, desirable for this class
of photography. A safe approximation
on a sunny day, in clear water, and
with the chamber lowered to a depth
of 20 ft., is ¹⁄₂₅ sec. at the F 8 stop. The
fastest plates or films obtainable should
be used for this work, making possible
a fairly rapid shutter speed. This tends
to overcome the movement of the subject
and possible movement of the
camera.</p>

<p>The camera should be focused while
in the chamber in order that the plate
glass may not disturb the focus. The
glass usually changes the focal length
of the lens slightly, hence this precaution
must be taken. The camera should
be focused in the chamber for a distance
of 10 ft., as this is the average at
which under-water photographs will be
taken ordinarily.</p>

<p>When attempting under-water photography
in cloudy waters, or at a considerable
depth, the necessary illumination
may be provided by a charge of
flash-light powder. For this purpose
another submarine chamber, similar to
that used for the camera, should be provided,
with a plate glass, ¹⁄₂ in. thick,
and a valve fitted into the top of the
chamber, and opening outward, so that

<p>Every pond, lake, and river abounds
in interesting and instructive subjects
for submarine photography. Along
the coast of Florida, and at many
points along the Pacific coast, are
waters of such clearness that pictures
may be taken at a depth of nearly a
hundred feet, without the use of artificial
illumination. These localities
abound in objects under water of great
interest, such as shipwrecks. The fascinating
art of taking pictures under
water does not make it necessary for
one to go to these places, for subjects
are easily available. Whenever the
submarine chamber is raised from the
water there is an element of mystery
involved, regarding what may be recorded
on the plate or film, and this is
an attractive feature of the diversion.</p>

<h2 class="lrgr nobreak">The Magic of Numbers<br>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> JAMES L. LANYON</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>That there are a great many magic
squares; that the numbers in these
squares are arranged according to a
definite system; that squares with very
remarkable properties are easily constructed,
are facts not generally
known.</p>

<p>Consider the magic <a href="#Fig223">square A</a> of 16
numbers. Add up any four numbers
straight across, up and down, or
diagonally—10 ways in all—and the
sum in each case will be 34. But that
is not all: Take the four numbers in
any one quarter of the square, as for
example, 15, 10, 4, and 5, and the sum
will be 34; or take the four central
numbers, or the four corner numbers,
and the result will be the same. But
even this does not exhaust the magic
of the square. Add any four numbers
arranged symmetrically around the
center, as 3, 10, 8, and 13, or 10, 4, 7,
and 13, and the result will also be 34.
In fact, it is really not necessary to
have them arranged symmetrically, because
it will be found that four numbers
arranged as are 6, 10, 11, and 7,
or 1, 4, 16, and 13 will produce the same
magic number of 34.</p>

<p>There are two other combinations
of the 16 numbers that will give the
same result. They are shown at <a href="#Fig223">B</a> and
<a href="#Fig223">C</a>. In fact the second one, B, not only
exhibits some of the former combinations,
but also includes such sets of
four as 14, 5, 3, and 12, or 15, 8, 2, and
9, which places to the credit of this
square numerous combinations. Such
special features as this simply add another
element of mystery and interest.
Thus, while the square B has these two
combinations exclusively to its credit,
the first, <a href="#Fig223">A</a>, and the third, C, have such
special arrangements as 5, 16, 1, and 12,
or 15, 6, 11, and 2. Also 10, 3, 5, and
16, or 4, 5, 14, and 11, making the total
number of such combinations for the
first square 34.</p>

<p>Magic squares of 25 numbers also
have remarkable properties. Examine
the <a href="#Fig223">square D</a> and note the many possible
combinations graphically set forth
in the small diagrams. Not only do
any five numbers in a row or along a
diagonal make 65, but almost any four
arranged around the center, with the
center number 13 added, will give the
same result.</p>

<p>This square is a good example by
which to illustrate one of the methods
of construction of these interesting devices.
Thus, place 1 in the middle
square of the top row, and then write
the numbers down consecutively, always
working in the direction of the
arrows as indicated. When any number
falls outside, as number 2 does at
the start, drop down to the extreme
square in the next row and insert the
number there, as was done in this case.
It will be observed that 4 falls outside,
and so it is moved to the proper square<span class="pagenum" id="Page223">[223]</span>
as suggested, which will be at the extreme
left of the next row above. Continuing,
it is found that at 6 it is necessary
to drop down one square and
continue in the direction of the arrows.
At 9 it is necessary to drop down to the
proper extreme square as shown. The
next number, 10, must again be provided
for at the square on the left of
the next higher row. The square ahead
being already filled, 11 is placed below;
after this there is “clear sailing” for a
time. In this manner magic squares
with seven or nine numbers to the side
may be made easily. When puzzles
and catch problems are under discussion,
it is always mystifying to take
one’s pencil and quickly make out a
magic square according to this easily
remembered method. The small diagrams
at D suggest some of the combinations.</p>

<p>Another method of constructing a
square of 25 numbers diagonally is
shown at <a href="#Fig223">E</a>. Place the outside numbers
in the open spaces at the opposite
side of the square, maintaining the
same triangular relation, which results
in the arrangement shown at <a href="#Fig223">F</a>. While
this combination is entirely different
from the previous one, it exhibits the
same mysterious properties.</p>

<p class="caption blankbefore75">The Cipher Code Illustrated in These Diagrams may
be Adapted for Wide Uses by the Substitution of
Appropriate Key Words for Those Shown</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>It is commonly known as the “Play
Fair” code and is in use in some of the
foreign military services. It is a substitutive
cipher which operates with
one or more key words, two letters in
the code being substituted for each two
letters in the text of the message. In
preparing the cipher code by this
method the key words are selected by
the correspondents and their location
in the cipher square mutually agreed
upon. A large square divided into 25
smaller squares is drawn, as shown in
<a href="#Fig224a">Fig. 1</a>, and the letters of the key words
entered into their proper spaces, the remaining
spaces being filled by other
letters of the alphabet. The key words
must not contain duplicate letters. The
letters I and J are considered as one
and entered in the same space, the letter
I being invariably used in enciphering.</p>

<p>Suppose that the two words “grant”
and “field” have been selected for the
key, the same to be entered respectively
in the spaces on the first and third horizontal
lines of the square. Then the
basis of the construction would be as
indicated in <a href="#Fig224a">Fig. 1</a>. Now fill in the remaining
fifteen spaces of the square
with other letters of the alphabet, beginning
at the blank space at the left
of the second line, entering the letters
in rotation and not using any letter of
the key words. The completed cipher
would then appear as shown in <a href="#Fig224b">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p>The text of the message to be sent is
then divided into groups of two letters
each and the equivalent substituted for
each pair. Where two like letters fall
in the same pair the letter X is inserted
between them and when the message
is deciphered this additional letter is
disregarded. If one letter is left over
after the last pair, simply add an X
to it and make a pair.</p>

<p>Suppose it is desired to send this
message in the cipher: “Will you meet
me as agreed.” Having three pairs of
the same letter, it will be necessary to
break them up by placing the letter X
between them. The message will then
be paired off as follows:</p>

<p class="codemessage">WI LX LY OU ME XE TM EA SA GR EX ED</p>

<p>The message may now be enciphered,
after considering three simple rules for
guidance: Every pair of letters in the
square must be either in the same vertical

or at the diagonally opposite corners of

squares within the large square.</p>

<p>In the first case, R and P are in the
same vertical line (the second), and the
next letter below, in each case, is substituted
for R and P, which are C and
W. If the pair consists of K and Y
(fourth vertical), substitute L for K
and go to the first horizontal line
(fourth vertical) for Y, substituting N
for Y. In the second case B and H are
in the same horizontal line (the second),
and thus substitute the next letters
to the right, which are C and K.
If the pair consists of P and U (fourth
horizontal), substitute Q for P and
then go back to the first vertical line
(fourth horizontal) and substitute O
for U. In the third case, R and S are at
the opposite corners of a rectangle.
Each letter of the pair is substituted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page225">[225]</span>
the letter in the other corner of the
rectangle on the same horizontal line
with it. Then R would be represented
by N, and S would be represented by
P. To illustrate further, NE would be
represented by AL; BZ would be represented
by MV; TP by RU.</p>

<p>The message may now be enciphered,
applying the rules:</p>

<p class="codemessage">WI LX LY OU ME XE TM EA SA GR EX ED<br>

<p>In sending this message, to make it
more difficult for the inquisitive cipher
expert, divide the substituted letters
into words of five each and give him
the added task of determining whether
the cipher used is the transposition or
the substitution method. The message
ready to hand to the telegrapher would
read:</p>

<p class="codemessage">RPEYS NPOHD AQMDQ HQNRA QALFX</p>

<p>In deciphering a message the method
is reversed. Take the message as received,
divide the letters into pairs, and
disregard the final X, which was put in
to make a five-letter word. Then apply
the key reversed. Practice it on the
above message to get the system with
respect to letters occurring at the end
of the lines. Where the letters of a
pair are in the same vertical line, substitute
for each the letter above; where
they are in the same horizontal line,
substitute the letter to the left; where
they are in the corners of a rectangle,
substitute the letters at the opposite
corners on the same horizontal line.
To test the understanding of the system,
the message given in <a href="#Fig224c">Fig. 3</a>, with
the key words “chair” in the first horizontal
line and “optun” in the fourth
line, may be deciphered. The message

upper brace. The lower one is made of
a strip of iron, ¹⁄₄ by 1¹⁄₄ by 12 in.,
drilled for ¹⁄₄-in. bolts, and bent at right

<h2 class="nobreak">Writing on a Moving Train</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Writing legibly on a fast-moving
train is difficult to a person unaccustomed
to it. The railroad conductor
knows the trick of it and manages to
get along quite satisfactorily. He prefers
to write in a standing position and
holds his right elbow firmly against
his side. The reason for this is that in
a sitting posture there is too much
lateral movement in the trunk of the
body, while in a standing position this
is more easily controlled. When the
arm swings freely, as in ordinary writing,
several joints of the body are affected
in the process, each of which is
capable of its own motion. Holding
the elbow against one’s ribs “breaks”
these motion tendencies, except that of
the wrist, which movement is necessary
in writing, and thus the pencil, or
pen, is more easily controlled.</p>

<p>The same principles modified apply
in using a typewriter on a moving
train. Many traveling men, news correspondents,
and others, carry portable
typewriters and do much of their writing
while traveling on trains, not to
mention the various railroad and government
men who travel in office cars
and necessarily must get out their correspondence
en route. It is extremely
difficult to execute neat typewriting on
a moving train with free-arm movement,
even though the central portion<span class="pagenum" id="Page229">[229]</span>
of the car where the vibration and
swing is less severe, is selected. As I
am employed in such capacity, I had
to evolve some plan to expedite the
work. I am able to do typewriting
quite rapidly by resting the palm of
the hands, near the wrists, against the
front edge of the typewriter frame surrounding
the keyboard, and using the
swing of the fingers instead of that of
the whole arm, as in ordinary typewriting.—Victor
Labadie. Dallas, Tex.</p>

a little practice will soon determine the
best position for ease in operation.

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">T</span><span class="afterlargecap">he</span> electric locomotive described
may be constructed by boys having
average mechanical ability and the
necessary tools. However, in any
piece of mechanical construction care
must be taken to follow the instructions.
The material required is inexpensive,
and the pleasure derived
from such a toy is well worth the time
used in its construction.</p>

<p>The making of the outfit may be
divided into three parts, the first of
which is the motor; <a href="#Page237">second</a>, the truck
which is to carry the motor and the
body of the car, and <a href="#Page243">third</a>, the track
system upon which the engine is to
operate. A side view of the locomotive
is shown in <a href="#Fig231">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p>The motor is of the series type, having
its field and armature terminals
connected to the source of electrical
energy through a special reversing
switch. By this means
the rotation of the armature
may be reversed to make the
locomotive travel forward or
backward. The armature and
field are constructed of sheet-iron
stampings, riveted together.</p>

<p>The detailed construction of
the armature and its dimensions
are shown in <a href="#Fig232">Fig. 2</a>. The
shaft upon which the armature
core and commutator are to be
rigidly mounted is made of a piece
of steel rod, ⁷⁄₃₂ in. in diameter. A portion
of this rod, 2¹⁄₄ in. long, is threaded
with a fine thread, and two small brass,
or iron, nuts are provided to fit it. The
ends of the rod are turned down to a
diameter of ¹⁄₈ in. for a distance of
¹⁄₈ in. These are to fit in the bearings
that are to be made later.</p>

<p>Cut from thin sheet iron a sufficient
number of disks, 1¹⁄₈ in. in diameter,
to make a pile exactly ⁵⁄₈ in. thick
when they are securely clamped together.
Drill a hole in the center of
each of these disks, of such a size
that they will slip on the shaft snugly.
Remove the rough edges from the disks
and see that they are flat. Cut two
disks of the same size, from a piece of
¹⁄₁₆-in spring brass, and drill a hole in
the center of each, so that they will
slip on the shaft. Place all these disks
on the shaft, with the brass ones on the
outside, and draw them up tightly with
the nuts provided. Be sure to get the
laminated core in the proper position
on the shaft by observing the dimensions
given in the illustration, <a href="#Fig232">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 1</span><br>

</div><!--container-->

<p>After the disks have been fastened,
clamp the shaft in the chuck of a
lathe and turn down the edges of all
the disks so that they form a smooth<span class="pagenum" id="Page232">[232]</span>
cylinder, 1¹⁄₁₆ in. in diameter. Draw a
circle on the side of one of the brass
disks, ³⁄₃₂ in. from the edge, while the
shaft is held in the chuck. Divide this
circle into eight equal parts and make
a center-punch mark at each division.
Drill eight holes through the core
lengthwise with a ³⁄₁₆-in. drill. If the
centers of the holes have been properly
located, all the metal on the outside
will be cut away, as shown in the end
view, at the right in <a href="#Fig232">Fig. 2</a>. The width
of the gaps, F, G, H, etc., thus formed,
should be about ¹⁄₁₆ in. Smooth off all
the edges with a fine file after the holes
are drilled.</p>

<p>A cross-sectional view of the commutator
is shown at the extreme left,
<a href="#Fig232">Fig. 2</a>. It is constructed as follows:
Take a rod of copper or brass, ⁷⁄₈ in.
diameter, and 1¹⁄₄ in. long; clamp one
end in the chuck of a lathe. Turn the
other end down to a diameter of ³⁄₄ in.,
and drill a ¹⁄₂-in. hole through it at the
center. Cut away the metal from the
end to form a disklike recess.</p>

<p>Cut off a disk, ⁵⁄₁₆ in. thick, measuring
from the finished end, from the
piece of stock. Place this disk in a
chuck, with the unfinished end exposed,
and cut away the metal in a dish
form, as shown at B. Cut small slots,
into which the ends of the wires used
in winding are to be soldered, as shown
at 1, 2, 3, etc., in the right-hand view of
<a href="#Fig232">Fig. 2</a>. Obtain two brass nuts, about
¹⁄₄ in. in thickness, and turn their edges
down so that they correspond in form
to those shown at C and D. Divide the
disk ring, just made, into eight equal
parts, by lines drawn across it through
the center. Cut eight slots at these
points, in the rim of the disk. These
cuts should be through the rim. Fill
each of the slots with a piece of mica
insulation.</p>

<p class="caption allclear">How the Armature Core is Made of Soft-Iron Disks for the Lamination, at the Left. Diagram for the
Winding of the Armature Coils and Their Connection to the Commutator, at the Right</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Place one of the nuts on the shaft
and then a washer of mica insulation
shown by the heavy lines, near <a href="#Fig232">A and
B</a>; then the ring, a second piece of
mica, and last the nut, C. The latter
should be drawn up tightly, so that the
insulation in the slots in the disk are
opposite the drilled slots in the armature
core, as shown in the right-hand
view of Fig. 2. After the disk has been
fastened securely, test it to learn
whether it is insulated from the shaft.
This is done by means of a battery and
bell, connected in series, one terminal
of the circuit being connected to the
disk, and the other to the shaft. If the
bell rings when these connections are
made, the ring and shaft are not insulated.
The disk must then be remounted,
using new washers of mica
insulation. Mica is used because of its
ability to withstand a higher degree of
heat than most other forms of insulation.</p>

<p>Each of the eight segments of the
dished disk should be insulated from
the others. Make a test to see if the
adjacent commutator segments are insulated
from each other, and also from
the shaft. If the test indicates that any
segment is electrically connected to
another, or to the shaft, the commutator
must be dismantled, and the
trouble corrected.</p>

<p>The armature is now ready to be
wound. Procure ¹⁄₈ lb. of No. 26 gauge
insulated copper wire. Insulate the
shaft, at E, with several turns of thin<span class="pagenum" id="Page233">[233]</span>
cloth insulation, and also insulate similarly
the nuts holding the armature
core and the inside nut holding the
commutator. Cut several pieces from
the cloth insulation, wide enough to
cover the walls of the slots in the core,
and long enough to extend at least ¹⁄₁₆
in. beyond the core at the ends. Insulate
slots F and G thus, and wind 15
turns of the wire around the core
lengthwise, passing the wire back
through the slot F, across the back end
of the core, then toward the front end
through slot G, and back through F,
and so on. About 2 in. of free wire
should be provided at each end of the
coils.</p>

<p>In passing across the ends of the armature,
all the turns are placed on one
side of the shaft, and so as to pass on
the left side, the armature being viewed
from the commutator end. The second
coil, which is wound in the same
grooves, is then passed on the right
side, the third on the left, and so on.
After this coil is completed test it to
see if it is connected to the armature
core. If such a condition is found, the
coil must be rewound. If the insulation
is good, wind the second coil,
which is wound in the same slots, F
and G, and composed of the same number
of turns. Insulate the slots H and
J, and wind two coils of 15 turns each
in them, observing the same precautions
as with the first two coils. The
fifth and sixth coils are placed in slots
K and L, and the seventh and eighth,
in slots M and N.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the half coils,
slots, and commutator segments is
given in detail in <a href="#Fig232">Fig. 3</a>. Each coil is
reduced to one turn in the illustration,
in order to simplify it. From an inspection
of this diagram it may be seen
that the outside end of the second coil
in the upper row of figures, at the left
end, is connected to the inside end of
the fourth coil at segment 1, in the
lower row of figures, representing the
segments of the commutator. The outside
end of the fourth coil is connected
with the inside end of the sixth coil,
at segment 2; the outside end of the
sixth coil is connected with the inside
end of the eighth coil at segment 3;
the outside end of the eighth coil is
connected to the inside end of the coil 1
at segment 4; the outside end of the
coil 1 is connected to the inside end of
the coil 3 at segment 5; the outside
end of the third coil is connected to the
inside end of the fifth coil at segment
6; the outside end of the fifth coil is
connected to the inside end of the
seventh coil at segment 7; the outside
end of the seventh coil is connected to
the inside end of the second coil at
segment 8, and the outside end of the
second coil is connected to segment 1.

<p>In winding the coils on the core,
their ends should be terminated close
to the commutator segments to which
they are to be connected, in order to
simplify the end connections. After
all the coils are wound and properly

where the marks were made. Lay out
and drill ¹⁄₈-in. holes, A, B, C, and D,
Fig. 5. Bend the upper portion of the
pieces at right angles to the lower portion,
along the dotted lines E, and then
bend the end of the horizontal portions
down along the dotted lines F, until
they are parallel with the main vertical
parts of the pieces. The latter
should be bent so that one forms the
left support and the other the right, as
shown in <a href="#Fig234a">Fig. 6</a>.</p>

<p>Bend the projections G and H at
right angles to the vertical main parts.
The parts at the bottom are bent, one
back along the dotted line J and forward
on the line K; the other forward
on the line L and back on the line M.
The pieces are then mounted, on the
side of the field structure, as shown
in <a href="#Fig234a">Fig. 6</a>. The supports are fastened
in place with five small bolts. The
grooves N and O, in <a href="#Fig234a">Fig. 5</a>, are used
in mounting the motor on the axles of
the truck. They will not be cut until
after the truck is constructed.</p>

<p>The brush holders are made of two
pieces of hexagonal brass, each 1 in. in<span class="pagenum" id="Page235">[235]</span>
length, having a ¹⁄₈-in. hole drilled in
the end to a depth of ⁷⁄₈ in., and a
threaded hole in the other end, for a
small machine screw, as shown in <a href="#Fig234b">Fig.
7</a>. Two holes are drilled and threaded
in one side of each of these pieces.
These holders are to be mounted, by
means of screws, through the holes A,
B, C, and D, <a href="#Fig234a">Fig. 5</a>. Each holder must
be insulated from its support. The
distance of the holder from its support
should be such that the opening in its
end is in the center of the commutator.
The brushes are made of very fine copper
gauze, rolled to form a rod. They
are made long enough to extend about
¹⁄₂ in. into the holder, when they are
resting on the commutator. A small
spiral spring is placed in the holder,
back of the end of the brush, and which
will serve to keep the latter in contact
with the commutator.</p>

<p>Temporary connections are made and
the motor is tested with a six-volt battery.
The construction of the motor
may be modified as to the length of
shaft, and other minor details, and may
be used for other purposes by fitting
it with pulleys, a countershaft, or
other transmission devices.</p>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">S</span><span class="afterlargecap">uccessful</span> operation and construction
that is feasible, yet of a
reasonable standard of workmanship,
are the essentials of the locomotive
truck and cab described as the second
feature of the locomotive and track
system under consideration. The materials
suggested are those found to
be satisfactory, but substitutes may be
used if caution is observed. The completed
locomotive is shown in <a href="#Fig239">Figs. 1
and 2</a>. The outward aspect only is
presented, and, for the sake of clearness,
the portions of the motor and
driving rigging attached to it, that
project below the cab, are omitted,
These parts are shown assembled in
<a href="#Fig240a">Fig. 12</a>, and in detail in the succeeding
sketches.</p>

<p>The locomotive, apart from the
motor, consists of two main portions,
the truck and the cab. Consideration
will be given first to the building of
the truck and the fitting of the motor
into it. The mechanical and operative
features are to be completed before
beginning work on the cab, which is
merely a hood fixed into place with
screws, set into the wooden cab base.</p>

<p>Begin the construction with the
wheels, shown in <a href="#Fig239">Fig. 3</a>. Make the
axles of ¹⁄₈-in. round steel rod, cut 3³⁄₁₆
in. long.</p>

<p>Turn four wheels of ³⁄₈-in. brass.
Drill a ¹⁄₈-in. hole in two of them so
that they may be forced on the slightly
tapered ends of the axle. Drill a ¹⁄₄-in.
hole in each of the other wheels, and
solder a collar, A, <a href="#Fig239">Fig. 3</a>, on the inside
surfaces of them. Two fiber bushings,
B, should be provided to fit in the
¹⁄₄-in. openings in the wheels and to
fit tightly on the ends of the axles.
This insulates the wheels on one side
of the truck from those on the other.
If the rails forming the track are insulated
from each other, the current
supplied to the motor may pass in on
one rail to the two insulated wheels,
then to a brush, which bears on the
brass collar A, through the windings
of the motor, through the reversing
switch to the other set of wheels, and
back to the source of energy over the
other rail, as shown in <a href="#Fig241b">Fig. 15</a>.</p>

<p>The wheels of the truck should fit
on the axles tightly, since no means
other than the friction will be employed
in holding them in position. If
the ends of the axles are tapered
slightly, the wheels may be forced into
place and will stay firmly. Do not
force them on until the truck is finally
assembled.</p>

<p>The truck frame should be constructed
next, and its details are shown
in <a href="#Fig239">Figs. 4 and 5</a>. Make two sidepieces
of ¹⁄₁₆-in. brass, 9³⁄₄ in. long and 1⁵⁄₈ in.
wide, cutting out portions, as shown,
in order to reduce the weight. This
also gives the appearance of leaf
springs.</p>

<p>The two rectangular openings are to
accommodate the axle bearings. They
should be cut to precise dimensions,
and their edges should be squared off.
Extensions, ¹⁄₁₆ in. wide, are provided
at the middle of the upper edges of
each of these openings. They are to
hold the upper end of the coil springs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page238">[238]</span>
which are to rest in the holes cut into
the bearings, as shown at G, <a href="#Fig239">Fig. 7</a>,
and also in assembled form, <a href="#Fig239">Fig. 6</a>.</p>

<p>Next drill four ¹⁄₈-in. holes in each
of the sidepieces, as indicated at the
letters H₁ to H₄, <a href="#Fig239">Fig. 5</a>. For the cross
supports use four pieces of brass rod,
¹⁄₄ in. square, and square off the ends
to a length of 2³⁄₄ in. Drill holes in
the center of the ends and tap them
for ¹⁄₈-in. machine screws. Join the
side and crosspieces as shown in <a href="#Fig239">Fig. 4</a>.
Two fiber washers about ¹⁄₁₆ in. thick
should be placed on each axle at E
and F, to hold the wheels from contact
with the sidepieces.</p>

<p>Details of a bearing for the axles
are shown in <a href="#Fig239">Fig. 7</a>. The hole G carries
the lower end of the coil spring,
and the hole J is the bearing socket
for the axle. Four spiral springs, having
an outside diameter of ¹⁄₈ in. and
a length of ¹⁄₂ in. when extended,
should be provided. The extensions
on the sides of the bearings fit against
the inner faces of the sides of the
truck. They hold the bearings in position
and prevent them from falling out.</p>

<p>The base of the cab is made of wood,
dimensioned as in <a href="#Fig239">Fig. 10</a>. The center
of the piece is cut away so as to provide
a space for the motor, which extends
above the upper edge of the
truck, as shown in <a href="#Fig240a">Fig. 12</a>. This block
is fastened in place by four screws
through the upper crosspieces at the
ends of the truck. The base should be
made and fitted into place temporarily
so as to be available in observing how
the motor and its fittings are placed
in relation to it. For convenience in
assembling the parts of the truck and
setting the motor, it may be removed
readily.</p>

<p>Assembling the truck, including the
motor, probably requires the most
painstaking effort of any part of the
construction of the locomotive. Too
great care cannot be taken with it, as
the dimensions are carefully worked
out and failure to observe them may
cause errors sufficient to make the locomotive
unserviceable. Before undertaking
this work it would be well to
examine carefully the arrangement of
the parts as shown in <a href="#Fig240a">Fig. 12</a>. The
upper view shows the relation of the
driving gears in mesh, and the lower
view shows the machinery of the truck
as seen from above.</p>

<p>The power from the motor is transmitted
to one set of wheels by means
of a small gear on the armature shaft
engaging an intermediate gear, which
in turn engages a large gear attached
to the inside of one of the truck wheels.
The center of the armature shaft is
1⁵⁄₁₆ in. from the center of the power
axle, when both axles are in the slots
provided in the motor frame, <a href="#Fig240a">Fig. 12</a>.
The gears for the transmission may
now be selected. The gear on the
armature shaft should be as small, and
that on the axle as large, as practicable.
The intermediate gear should be of
such a size that it will close the space
between the small gear on the armature
shaft and the large one on the
axle. Gears suitable for the transmission
may be purchased at a clock store
for a small sum. If gears of exactly
the proper size cannot be obtained
readily, the position of the intermediate
gear may be adjusted to produce
a proper meshing of the gears.</p>

<p>Mount the small gear on the end of
the armature shaft away from the commutator,
so that there will be about
¹⁄₁₆-in. clearance between the outside
surface and the shoulder at the end of
the shaft. Fit it on tightly so that no
other means of fastening will be necessary.
Mount the large gear on the
inside surface of one of the truck
wheels, as shown in <a href="#Fig239">Figs. 3</a> and <a href="#Fig240a">12</a>.
Place the axle of the truck into the
proper grooves in the motor frame, and
mark the position of the center of the
intermediate gear, when it engages the
other gear. Drill a hole in the extension
on the motor frame, provided as
a support, to fit a small bolt with
which the intermediate gear is fastened.</p>

<p>Place a washer between the gear and
the piece upon which it is mounted,
and a locknut on the threaded end of
the bolt, drawing it up so that the
gear has only sufficient play.</p>

sufficient play should be allowed to
prevent excessive friction.</p>

<p>The reversing switch, which is to be
mounted on the under side of the
motor frame, is shown in <a href="#Fig240b">Figs. 13</a> and
<a href="#Fig241a">14</a>. It is provided with a control lever
which projects out from under the
truck frame. A small movement of
the lever will produce the necessary
changes in the connections. The operation
of the switch may be understood
readily from the diagram shown in
<a href="#Fig241b">Fig. 15</a>. The moving element of the
switch carries two pieces of copper,
E and F, which connect the four stationary
pieces of copper, A, B, C, and
D, when the lever attached to E and
F is moved to either side of its central
position. The pieces of copper which
are moved—E and F—are shown outside
of the stationary pieces in Fig. 15
for purposes of a diagram only, and
are actually directly over the ring
formed by the stationary pieces.</p>

<img src="images/illo244b.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">Fig. 13, Details of the Switch, Shaded Portions Being
of Fiber Insulation</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The operation of the switch is as
follows: Assuming that the current
enters at the terminal marked 1 and
leaves at the terminal marked 2, then
the direction of the current in the armature
and series field will be as indicated
in the diagrams. The direction
of the current in the series-field winding
is different in the two cases, which
will result in opposite rotation of the
armature.</p>

<p>The base of the switch is made of
¹⁄₁₆-in. fiber insulation; its dimensions
are shown in <a href="#Fig240b">Fig. 13</a>. It is to be
mounted on the two pieces projecting
outward on the under side of the
motor frame, as shown in <a href="#Fig240a">Fig. 14</a>.
Drill a small hole in each of these projections,
as indicated by the letters H₁
and H₂, and tap them to take a small
machine screw. Next drill two holes,
H₁ and H₂, Fig. 13, in the piece of
insulation, with centers the same distance
apart as those drilled in the projections.
One end of this piece of insulation
is extended to form a mounting
for a thin brass spring, the ends of
which bear on the brass collars insulated
from the axles, as shown in <a href="#Fig240a">Figs.
12</a> and <a href="#Fig240b">13</a>. The form of this spring
and the method of mounting it are also
shown in Fig. 13.</p>

<p>The sections which come into contact
in the switch are made as follows:
Mount four pieces of thin copper or
brass on the fiber base with rivets having
their heads countersunk. Cut a
disk, 1 in. in diameter, from a piece of
sheet insulation and drill a hole H, in
the center of it. Also drill a similar
hole H₃ in the center of the switch
base. Mount two pieces of copper or<span class="pagenum" id="Page241">[241]</span>
brass, E and F, on the under side of
this disk. The edges and ends of all
six pieces of metal should be rounded
off so that the pieces E and F will
move freely over those on the base.
The disk, or upper part of the switch,
may be attached to the base by means
of a small bolt placed through the holes
at the center. A small spiral spring
should be placed between the disk and
the lower end of this bolt so as to
keep the pieces of metal on the disk in
contact with those on the base. Attach
a small handle to the disk so that it
will extend out on one side of the
truck. Fix the switch into place by
bolts through the holes H₁ and H₂,
<a href="#Fig241a">Fig. 14</a>, on the bottom of the motor
frame. The electrical connections
should be made as shown in <a href="#Fig241b">Fig. 15</a>.</p>

<p>The detail of the couplers is shown
in <a href="#Fig239">Fig. 11</a>. They are made of brass,
fitted to the upper crosspieces and
fixed to them by machine screws.
“Cowcatchers” may be made for the
ends of the locomotive. Sheet metal,
corrugated appropriately and bent to
the proper shape, will afford the easiest
method of making them. Those shown
in <a href="#Fig239">Figs. 1 and 2</a> are made of strips
soldered together, and also to the
upper crosspieces; they are strengthened
by a cross strip at the bottom,
opposite the point.</p>

<p>The cab is to be made apart from
the truck and is to fit upon the base,
as shown in <a href="#Fig239">Figs. 1 and 2</a>. It is fixed
into place by four screws and can be
removed easily for examination of the
locomotive mechanism. The dimensions
for the cab are shown in <a href="#Fig239">Figs. 8

<p>Sheet metal or wood may be used
in the construction, and the joints soldered
on the inside or riveted, as shown
in the illustration. The window and
door openings may be cut out or

mounted on the ends of the cab, adding
to its appearance. The headlights
shown in <a href="#Fig239">Figs. 1 and 2</a> may be cut
from wood or made of sheet metal.
Light bulbs may be installed, and their
voltage should correspond to that of
the motive energy. The terminals for
the sockets of the headlight lamps
should be connected to the frame of
the truck and to the spring, which
bears upon the brass collars on the
wheels, which are insulated from the
axles, as shown at A, <a href="#Fig239">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

<p>This completes the locomotive in all
essential details and it is ready to be
placed upon the track to be tested. The
track system will be considered in a
subsequent <a href="#Page243">article</a>.</p>

<p>When flour paste becomes watery

the best flour should be used for making
paste. Many paper hangers do not
boil paste. They make a stiff batter
with lukewarm water, stirring out all
lumps, and then briskly stir in boiling
water. When the mass thickens continue
stirring, but add no more hot
water. Pour a little cold water on top

<p>Pointing a camera up, or down, as

tripod socket to fit the tripod, while
the upper one has a tripod screw for
fastening the camera. Two metal

through which binding screws are fitted,
and clamped with wing nuts. This
permits the camera to be tilted at various
angles, or reversed for vertical
pictures, without removing it from the

model described in the
<a href="#Page231">previous</a> <a href="#Page237">articles</a> is feasible only with
a properly constructed track system.
This equipment, including curves and
switches, is to be described in this, the
final, article. Two functions are to be
performed by the track system: It must
serve as a support and guide for the
locomotive and provide a path over
which the current from the source of
energy is supplied to the motor within
the locomotive and returned to the
source. On this basis, then, the construction
may be divided into two
parts: the mechanical and the electrical
features. If the mechanical construction
is not practical and accurate, the
locomotive will not operate satisfactorily.
The electrical connections must
be given due care also.</p>

Wide and 16 inches Long, to the Form Shown
in Fig. 1. The Rail Connections are
Formed as Shown in Fig. 2</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The track should be of uniform
gauge; the joints should be solid and
free from irregularities, which cause
“bumping” in passing over them. The
material used should be stiff, so that it
will retain its form, and preferably non-rusting.
The rails must be insulated
from each other, and proper means
must be provided for making suitable
electrical connections between the various
sections. The construction of a
straight and a curved section of track,
together with a switch and signal,
adaptable to various places on the system,
will be considered in detail.</p>

<p>The straight sections may be made
any suitable length; sections 16 in. long
will be found convenient, as the metal
pieces forming the rails may be bent
into shape easily when they are short
rather than long. The possibility of
various combinations of straight and
curved sections in a given area is increased
by having the sections shorter.
The rails may be made from tinned
sheet-metal strips, by taking pieces, 16
in. long and 1¹⁄₂ in. wide, and bending
them into the form shown in <a href="#Fig243b">Fig. 1</a>.
The rails should be mounted on small
wooden sleepers, ¹⁄₂ by ¹⁄₂ by 4 in., by
means of small nails, or preferably
small screws. The distance between
the centers of the rails should be 2 in.
The sections of track may be fastened
together at the ends by means of a special
connector, shown in <a href="#Fig243c">Fig. 2</a>, made
from thin metal, preferably spring
brass. The type of connector shown in
Fig. 2 will not prevent the sections
from pulling apart, and to prevent this,
a second connector, similar to that
shown in <a href="#Fig244a">Fig. 3</a>, should be made. The
sleepers at the ends of each section
should have one side beveled, as shown,
and these edges should be exactly one<span class="pagenum" id="Page244">[244]</span>
inch from the end of the rails. A
spring clip should be made, similar to
that shown, which will slip down on
the inside of the end sleepers and hold
the sections together.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>A better form of rail is shown in
<a href="#Fig244a">Figs. 3</a> and <a href="#Fig244b">4</a>, but it is somewhat more
difficult to construct. In this case, instead
of bending the piece of metal
forming the rail over on itself and closing
the space entirely, the metal is bent
over a round form, such as a piece of
wire, which may be removed, leaving
an opening through the upper part of
the rail from end to end. This gives a
better form to the tread of the rail and
at the same time provides an easy
means of connecting the ends of the
rails, as shown in <a href="#Fig244c">Fig. 5</a>. Small metal
pins, about 1 in. long, and of such a
diameter that they will just fit the circular
opening in the top of the rail, are
provided. One of these pins should be
fastened in one rail at each end of a
section, making sure that no rail has
more than one pin in it, and that the
arrangement of pins and rails corresponds
in all sections. With proper
care the various sections should fit together
equally well, and they may be
held together as shown in Fig. 3.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The curved sections may be made
from rails similar to those described
above, but some difficulty will be experienced
in bending them into a curve
because of the necessity of bending the
lower flange on edge. The difficulty
may be overcome by crimping in the
inner edge of the lower flange and expanding
the outer edge by hammering
it on a smooth surface. The radius of
the curve to which the inner rail should
be bent in order to give a section of
convenient length, and not too abrupt
a curve, is 21 in. The circumference
of such a circle is approximately 132
in., which, divided into eight sections,
gives 16¹⁄₂ in. as the length of the inner
rail of each section. Since the tread of
the track is 2 in., the radius of the
curve of the outer rail will be 23 in.
The circumference of the circle formed
by the outer rail is 145 in., which divided
into eight sections gives 18¹⁄₈ in.
as the length of the outer rail of each
section. These curved rails may be
mounted on sleepers, their ends being
held in place, and the various sections
fastened together, just as in the case of
the straight sections.</p>

<p>Some trouble may be experienced in
getting the curved rails properly
shaped, and it would be a good plan to
lay them out full size by drawing two
circles on a smooth surface having diameters
of 42 and 46 in., respectively,
and divide each of the latter into eight
equal parts. The form of the curve
between these division lines and the
lengths of the curves will correspond
to the shape and lengths of the rails
forming the curved sections of the
track. The pieces should be cut
slightly longer than required, and after<span class="pagenum" id="Page245">[245]</span>
they are bent into shape their length
can be determined precisely and extra
portions cut off. Each curved section
will correspond to ¹⁄₈ of the complete
circle, or 45°, as shown in <a href="#Fig244c">Fig. 6</a>.</p>

<p>The switches for the track may be of
two kinds: left and right. They are
named according to whether the car is
carried to the left or right of the main
track with reference to the direction in
which the car moves in entering the
switch. A left switch is shown in <a href="#Fig244d">Fig.
7</a>, and a right switch in <a href="#Fig244d">Fig. 8</a>, the direction
of movement being indicated
by the arrows.</p>

<p class="caption blankbefore75">The Crossings of the Rails must be Fitted Carefully, and the Movable

</div><!--container-->

<p>A detailed drawing of a right switch
is shown in <a href="#Fig245">Fig. 9</a>. Rail A corresponds
in form
and length
to the
outer rail
of one of
the curved
sections
previously
described;
rail B corresponds
to the inner
rail of
one of the
curved
sections
except
that 2¹⁄₂ in.
of straight
rail is added at the left end. Rail
C is a straight portion of rail, 18
in. in length, with a part of the base
cut away at the switch, and rail D is a
section of straight rail, 15¹⁄₂ in. in
length, with the base cut away where
it crosses rail A. The ends of rails D
and A are hinged at the points E and
F, 3³⁄₄ in. from the left end, with pins
driven into the ties. The outside edges
of the pieces G and H are filed off so
they will fit up against the rails C and
B respectively. Both the pieces G and
H are attached to a strip of fiber insulating
material, I, at their left-hand
ends, in such a way that when the piece
H is against the rail B, the piece G is
away from the rail C about ³⁄₁₆ in.;
when the end of the piece G is drawn
over against the rail C, the end of the
piece H is drawn away from the rail B
about ³⁄₁₆ in. With these two combinations
the car may be made to move
along the main track or to the right on
the curved track. The two long sleepers
J and K are to provide a mounting
for the switch-control lever and signal.</p>

<p>The rail A is not continuous where
the rail D crosses it, but is broken as
shown in the figure. A small notch
should be cut in the surface of the rail
D where it crosses the rail A, for the
flange of the car wheels to roll through
when the car is moving onto or off the
switch. The sections of the rails A and
D must be connected electrically. Rail
A must be
connected
to rail C,
and rail B
to rail D.</p>

<p>It is obvious
from
an inspection
of
<a href="#Fig245">Fig. 9</a>, at
L, that
rail D will
be connected
to
rail A
when the
car is on
the switch,
the car
wheels passing over the point L, and a
short circuit will result. This may be
prevented by insulating the short section
of the rail D at this point from the
remainder of the rail, but the length
of the insulated section must not be
greater than the distance between the
wheels on one side of the car; otherwise
the circuit through the motor
would be broken. If this is the case,
and the car stops on the main track
with both wheels on the insulated section,
it would be impossible to start the
locomotive until one wheel was moved
to a live part of the rail.</p>

<p>The switch control is shown in <a href="#Fig246a">Fig.
10</a>, and the letters C, G, and I correspond
to those given in <a href="#Fig245">Fig. 9</a>. A
¹⁄₈-in. rod, about 4 in. in length, is bent<span class="pagenum" id="Page246">[246]</span>
into the form shown at M. It is
mounted in a frame, the details of
which are shown in <a href="#Fig246a">Fig. 11</a>. A small
arm, N, with a hinged handle, O, is
soldered to the rod, after it is placed in
position in the switch frame. The arm
N and the lever P should be parallel
with each other. If properly constructed,
the handle O will drop into
the notches in the top of the switch
frame, and prevent the rod M from
turning. A connection should be made
from the lever P to the end of the piece
I, which will result in the switch being
operated when the rod M is rotated
one-fourth of a turn. After this connection
is made, the frame of the
switch should be fastened to the ends
of the long sleepers, which were provided
when the track part of the switch
was constructed. Two small disks,
mounted at right angles to each other,
will serve as signals when properly

<p>A small rheostat, which will give the
desired resistance, may be constructed
as follows: Obtain a piece of hard
wood, 4 by 5 in., and ³⁄₈ in. in thickness.
Lay out a curve on this piece, as shown
in <a href="#Fig246b">Fig. 12</a> by the row of small circles.
Procure eight round-headed brass machine
screws, about ¹⁄₈ in. in diameter
and ³⁄₄ in. in length, and 16 nuts to fit
them. Drill eight ¹⁄₈-in. holes along
the curve, spacing them ³⁄₈ in. apart.
File the heads of the screws off flat and
mount the screws in these holes.
Make a metal arm, S, and mount it on
a small bolt passing through a hole
drilled at the center from which the
curve was drawn, along which the
screws were mounted. This arm
should be of such a length that its outer
end will move over the heads of the
screws. Mount two binding posts, Q
and R, in the upper corners of the
board and connect R to screw No. 8,
and Q to the bolt holding the arm S in
place. Connect small resistance coils
between the screws, starting with
screw No. 2; screw No. 1 corresponds
to an open circuit and is shown in contact
with the arm S. Two stops, indicated
by the black spots, should be
provided, to prevent the arm from
moving back of screw No. 1 or beyond
screw No. 8. The board may now be
mounted on a suitable hollow base, and
the rheostat is complete.</p>

<p>Two binding posts should be
mounted on the ties of one section of
the track, and one of them electrically
connected to each of the two rails,
which will give an easy means of making
the necessary electrical connections
to the source of energy. After careful
examination, to make certain that the
locomotive is in running order, a test
run may be made. If the locomotive
operates properly and difficulty is experienced
when it is placed upon the
track, check up thoroughly on all rail
connections, insulations, and other
elements in the electrical equipment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page247">[247]</span>
Cars of a proper gauge may be coupled
to the locomotive, and “runs” made as
extensively as the track system will permit.</p>

<h2 class="lrgr nobreak">Measuring Resistance with a Lead Pencil<br>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> JOHN D. ADAMS</span></h2>

</div><!--container-->

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">T</span><span class="afterlargecap">here</span> are very few electrical experimenters
who can afford a
Wheatstone bridge for measuring
resistances, and yet, if one is to gain
any knowledge from his experiments,
it is very necessary to know what resistance
is being used, particularly in
handling 110 volts. The amateur will
find the following method very useful.</p>

<p>There are several brands of lead pencils,
the leads of which have a resistance
of 200 to 300 ohms, while others
have comparatively little resistance.
Soak several pencils—preferably the
large kind carpenters use—in water
over night so that the leads may be
removed without breaking. Connect
up two 40-watt lamps in series and
note how they burn. Then replace one
lamp with a lead and note the relative
intensity with which the remaining
lamp burns. If the lead is of a sufficiently
high resistance it will cut down
the illumination about as much as the
additional lamp.</p>

<p>Having selected a lead, mount it on
a suitable board, holding it in place
by clamping each end under a strip
of brass held down with wood screws.
Next screw in place two porcelain receptacles
and place three binding posts
in position, all as shown in the sketch.
Connect up as indicated, and attach a
short length of flexible cord, with a
metal tip on the free end, to one terminal
of the central receptacle. Procure
a cheap 75-ohm receiver and connect
it to the two ends of the pencil
lead. Finally glue on a paper scale.</p>

<div class="container w40emmax">

<img src="images/illo253b.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">The Lead Taken from a Lead Pencil and Used as a
Means of Measuring Resistance</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>To operate, place a high-resistance
lamp in the center receptacle—say, a
15-watt lamp—to prevent heating, and
almost any lamp of known wattage in
the other receptacle. From the rating
of this lamp the resistance may at once
be determined by Ohm’s law. Thus,
at 110 volts, a 25-watt lamp will have
a resistance of 484 ohms; a 40-watt
lamp 300 ohms, and a 60-watt lamp,
200 ohms. Connect the unknown resistance,
as shown in the drawing, and
move the metal tip on the end of the
flexible cord back and forth along the
pencil lead until a point is reached
where no sound is emitted by the receiver.
This point will be very well
defined, and as the connection is
moved away from it in either direction
the sound will increase rapidly.
Note the reading on the
scale, and then if a 40-watt lamp
is used in the end receptacle, the
unknown resistance will be = <span class="horsplit"><span class="top">300&#160;A</span>
<span class="bot">B</span></span>.
The resistance of the center lamp does
not enter into the computation, but by
changing the lamp in the end receptacle,
another set of figures may be obtained,
and a means had to secure
increased accuracy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A Simple Motor Controller</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>The controller described is very similar
in operation to the types of controllers
used on electric automobiles,
and its operation may be easily followed
by reference to the diagrammatic
representation of its circuits, and
those of a two-pole series motor to
which it is connected, as shown in <a href="#Fig250a">Fig.
1</a>. The controller consists of six flat
springs, represented as small circles
and lettered A, B, C, D, E, and F,
which make contact with pieces of narrow
sheet brass mounted on a small
wood cylinder, so arranged that it may
be turned by means of a small handle
located on top of the controller case
in either direction from a point called
neutral, which is marked N. When the
cylinder of the controller is in the neutral
position, all six contact springs are
free from contact with any metal on
the cylinder. The contacts around the
cylinder in the six different horizontal
positions are lettered G, H, J, K, L, and
M. There are three different positions
of the controller in either direction
from the neutral point. Moving the
cylinder in one direction will cause
the armature of the motor to rotate in
a certain direction at three different
speeds, while moving the cylinder in a
reverse direction will cause the armature
to rotate in the opposite direction
at three different speeds, depending
upon the exact position of the cylinder.
These positions are designated by
the letters O, P, and Q, for one way,
and R, S, and T, for the other.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 1</span><br>
Diagram of the Electrical Connections of a
Controller to a Two-Pole Series Motor</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Supposing the cylinder to be rotated
to the position marked O, the circuit
may be traced from the positive terminal
of the battery U, as follows: To
contact spring E, to strip of brass L, to
strip of brass M, to contact spring F,
through the field windings VV, to contact
spring D, to strip of brass K, to
strip of brass J, to contact spring C,
through resistance W and Y, to armature
Z, through armature to the negative
terminal of the battery. Moving
the cylinder to the position P merely
cuts out the resistance W, and to the
position Q, cuts out the remaining resistance
Y. The direction of the current
through the armature and series
field, for all positions of the cylinder
to the left, is indicated by the full-line
arrows. Moving the controller to the
positions marked R, S, and T, will result
in the same changes in circuit connections,
as in the previous case, except
the direction of the current in the series
field windings will be reversed.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap sstype">Fig. 2</span><br>
Upper-End View of the Controller, Showing the
Manner of Attaching the Springs</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The construction of the controller
may be carried out as follows: Obtain
a cylindrical piece of wood, 1³⁄₄ in. in
diameter and 3¹⁄₈ in. long, preferably
hard wood. Turn one end of this cylinder
down to a diameter of ¹⁄₂ in., and
drill a ¹⁄₄-in. hole through its center
from end to end. Divide the circumference<span class="pagenum" id="Page251">[251]</span>
of the small-diameter portion
into eight equal parts and drive a small
nail into the cylinder at each division
point, the nail being placed in the center
of the surface lengthwise and perpendicular
to the axis of the cylinder.
Cut off all the nail heads so that the
outer ends of the nails extend even
with the surface of the outer, or large-size,
cylinder. Divide the large part
into eight equal parts so that the division
points will be midway between the
ends of the nails, and draw lines the
full length of the cylinder on these
points. Divide the cylinder lengthwise
into seven equal parts and draw a
line around it at each division point.
Cut some ¹⁄₈-in. strips from thin sheet
brass and mount them on the cylinder
to correspond to those shown in <a href="#Fig250a">Fig.
1</a>. Any one of the vertical division
lines drawn on the cylinder may be
taken as the neutral point. The pieces
may be mounted by bending the ends
over and sharpening them so that they
can be driven into the wood. The various
strips of brass should be connected
electrically, as shown by the heavy
lines in Fig. 1, but these connections
must all be made so that they will not
extend beyond the outer surface of the
strips of brass.</p>

<p>A small rectangular frame is made,
and the cylinder is mounted in a vertical
position in it by means of a rod
passing down through a hole in the top
of the rectangle, through the hole in
the cylinder and partly through the
bottom of the rectangle. The upper
part of the rod may be bent so as to
form a handle. The rod must be fastened
to the cylinder in some convenient
way.</p>

<p>Make six flat springs similar to the
one shown at A, <a href="#Fig250b">Fig. 2</a>, and mount
them on the inside of the rectangle so
that they will correspond in their vertical
positions to the strips of brass on
the cylinder. Six small binding posts
mounted on the outside of the box and
connected to these springs serve to
make the external connections, and
they should be marked so that they
may be easily identified.</p>

<p>A flat spring, ¹⁄₄ in. wide, is made
similar to the one shown at B, <a href="#Fig250b">Fig. 2</a>.
Mount this spring on the inside of the
rectangle so it will mesh with the ends
of the nails in the small part of the
cylinder. The action of this spring is
to make the cylinder stop at definite
positions. The top of the case should
be marked so that the position of the
handle will indicate the position of the
cylinder. Stops should also be provided
so that the cylinder case cannot
be turned all the way around.</p>

<p>A very neat and workmanlike push
button may be made in the following
manner: Procure an unused tan-shoe
eyelet with an
opening about
³⁄₁₆ in. in diameter,
and at the
proper point drill a hole into the board
in which the button is to be set. Force
the eyelet in flush, using a little shellac
to hold it in tightly. For the button
proper, polish off and round one end
of a piece of brass rod of a diameter
that will move freely up and down in
the eyelet. Solder a small piece of
sheet brass across the lower end to
keep it from coming out, then adjust
and fasten on the two contact pieces,
all as indicated in the sketch. The
larger piece should be quite springy
so as to bring the button back each
time. The connections may be made
by slipping the wires under the heads
of the two wood screws that hold the
contact pieces in place.</p>

<p>As every experimenter knows, it is
almost impossible to drill a hole in the
varnished base of an instrument without
leaving a raw edge. Under such
circumstances, when it is desired to
make an opening for conducting cords,
and the like, simply drill a hole with
an ordinary drill and then set in a
small shoe eyelet, which immediately
presents a very finished appearance.</p>

<p class="caption">The Motor is Constructed of Pieces of Tin, a Nail,
and Some Wood Blocks</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The illustration shows a small electric
motor of such simple construction
that it can be easily made from odds
and ends to be found in any amateur
workshop. Cut six strips, ¹⁄₂ in. wide
and 3¹⁄₂ in. long, from an old tin can,
and bend them together into a U-shape.
This forms the magnet A. The outside
piece should be a trifle longer than
the others so that its ends can be
turned over the other ends to keep
them all in place. Screw this down on
a small wood base. At one side of the
wood base, fix an upright, B, and on
top, a light wood bracket, C, to take
the upper bearing of the motor. The
shaft D is simply a wire nail with the
head filed off and filed to a point.
Drive it through a 1¹⁄₂-in. length of the
same kind of material as used for the
magnet. This forms the rotating armature E.</p>

<p>Make a slight indentation with a
center punch, or strong nail, exactly in
the center of the base portion of the
magnet to take the lower end of the
shaft. For the upper bearing file the
end of a brass screw off flat and make
a similar indentation with a center
punch, or by a few turns of a small
drill. This screw should be adjusted
in the bracket until the shaft rotates
freely with the armature just clearing
the tips of the magnet. Wind about 40
turns of fairly thin cotton-covered copper
wire—No. 24 or 36 gauge is suitable—around
each limb of the magnet,
first covering the latter with paper, to
prevent the possibility of short-circuiting.
The windings should be in opposite
directions so that the connecting
piece of the wire from one coil to the
other passes across diagonally as shown
in the illustration.</p>

<p>The brush F is formed by doubling
up one of the free ends of the windings
after removing the cotton covering and
fixing it firmly with two screws to the
side of the upright. After attaching, it
should be bent until the outer end bears
lightly on the shaft. Remove the shaft
and at the point where the brush
touched, file two flat surfaces on opposite
sides of the nail in a direction at
right angles to the longitudinal center
line of the armature. On replacing the
shaft the brush should be adjusted so
that it makes contact twice in a revolution
and remains clear at the flat portions.
Connect up to a battery, one
wire to the screw at the top of the motor
and the other end to the open end
of the windings. Give the armature a
start and it will run at a terrific speed.—Contributed

no current is passing. On account of
its shape, the higher the armature rises,
the more iron it presents to the influence
of the magnet, and, on the other
hand, the greater will be the effect of
gravity. The advantage of this type
of control is the elimination of the irregular
readings of the scale, due to the
law of inverse squares, that usually
follow when any method depending
upon a variable distance is used.
Further, the readings can be had as desired
by altering the taper of the armature,
its thickness, or its distance from
the magnet, and also by adding a small
weight of nonmagnetic material at the
bottom. As most commercial circuits
supply alternating current, the friction
of the bearings does not affect the readings,
since the alternations set up a decided
vibration in the entire moving
system, thus eliminating static friction.</p>

is Not Desired or Necessary</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>In view of the variations above referred
to, it will be evident that it is
not very essential of what dimensions
the apparatus is made. The instrument
that I use has a base measuring
2¹⁄₂ in. by 5 in. The coil is built on a
tube of glued paper, and contains about
15 ft. of No. 16 gauge wire. The
terminals consist of the brass bolts
taken from discarded dry cells. A steel
sewing needle serves as a shaft, and a
piece of wire for the pointer. The
various joints are made with soft
solder, and suitable stops are provided
to keep the armature from shifting
laterally. In calibrating, a blank scale
should be glued in position and as
many 55-watt lamps as possible arranged
so that they can be placed in
the circuit, one at a time. On a 110-volt
line, each lamp added will mark a
half-ampere point. If a sufficient number
of lamps to carry the scale high
enough cannot be secured temporarily,
a resistance of some 20 or 30 ohms
should be placed in the circuit without
any lamps. Note the reading in
amperes on the scale thus far constructed,
and then begin adding the
lamps again, making a mark on the
scale as each lamp is added. In this
manner a scale may be built up sufficiently
accurate for all practical purposes.</p>

<p>If two identical coils are made in<span class="pagenum" id="Page254">[254]</span>
place of one, the additional coil can be
placed in parallel with the instrument
as a shunt, thus doubling its
capacity and making it necessary, of
course, to multiply all readings by two.</p>

<p>The two end pieces should be

long braces should be accurately
squared and finished at the ends; the

of the long braces, and the ends are
the short braces. This box is securely
put together with nails, and then
screwed in position with round-head
wood screws so as to be flush with the
top edge of the end pieces. The lower
brace is secured in place with screws.
In putting on the leather top, ¹⁄₂ in.

<p class="volumereference">[The various materials referred to in this article by number or size were described in detail in
an article on “A Reed Basket,” in the Boy Mechanic, Book 2, page 257.]</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">R</span><span class="afterlargecap">eed</span> furniture has become very
popular within the last few years,
and the newer designs and methods
have been so attractive as to place this
constructive effort among the handicraft
series of modern art. It is possible
so to analyze, simplify, and illustrate
this work as to make it feasible
for amateurs, and at the same time
there are possibilities which involve
problems that may try the ability of
the skilled workman. In other words,
there are possibilities of progress in
this kind of furniture making. There
are places where careful weaving is the
principal aim; again particular attention
will be given to corners, or, perhaps,
a nicety of modeling will be found
necessary to
bring out the
proper curves
involved.</p>

<p>Each piece
of reed furniture
has a
framework,
usually of
dowels, but it
may also be
made of boards
in such models
as small tables,
dressers, bedsteads,
chests,
etc. The board
construction is more often covered with
flat reed. In footstools there are both
kinds of framework. The illustrations
show the same parts marked with the
same letters throughout the series of
sketches.</p>

<div class="container w35emmax">

<img src="images/illo259.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">The Framework of the Stool
is Made of Large Dowels,
Then Covered with Windings
of Reed and a Woven Reed
Top and Apron</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The framework of the stool is shown
in <a href="#Fig257">Fig. 1</a>, in which the rails and posts
are made of dowels, ³⁄₄ in. in diameter,
and the braces of dowels, ⁵⁄₈ in. in
diameter. It will be noticed that the
posts extend to the top of the frame
for strength in this manner of construction.
If the rails rested on top of the
post S, the nails would have to be
driven into the end grain of the wood,
which makes the strength depend entirely
on the holding power of the nail
in this position, as there is no binding of
the upper part to the posts in the weaving.
With the post extending to the
top, the nail passes through the upper
part of the post and into the end grain
of the rails, and the rails are bound together
horizontally by the weaving.</p>

<p>The material for the frame consists
of the following dowel stock: two
pieces for rails, ³⁄₄ in. by 14 in. long;
two pieces for rails, ³⁄₄ in. by 9 in. long;
four posts, ³⁄₄ in. by 7 in. long, and two
braces, ⁵⁄₈ in. by 17 in. long. These
pieces are shown in <a href="#Fig257">Fig. 2</a>. If notches
are cut with a small saw, a coping saw
preferred, in the ends of each rail and
in the braces, as shown in <a href="#Fig257">Fig. 3</a>, they
will fit to the
posts better
and make a
stronger joint.
While different
makers
use a finishing
nail; a barbed
or corrugated,
nail; or a cemented,
or
glue-coated,
nail, I find the
best to be an
ordinary
4-penny nail,
which answers
the purpose well. Do not drive the nail
through the posts without first drilling
a hole with a ¹⁄₁₆-in. drill. A small
hand or breast drill will be needed for
this work.</p>

<p>Before nailing the frame together,
the holes for the spokes in weaving
should be drilled in the rails. The
spokes may be No. 4 and the weavers
No. 3 reed. The No. 4 reed requires a
¹⁄₈-in. hole. The hole for the top and
end side spokes may be combined, as
shown in <a href="#Fig257">Fig. 4</a>. The dotted lines
show the vertical and horizontal diameters,
and E the outside and F the inside
of the rail, one hole being represented
as sawed in two. The spokes<span class="pagenum" id="Page256">[256]</span>
for the top extend down and out at the
ends, and each may be of one piece, 32
in. long. As there are no spokes at the
top extending to the side pieces, short
spokes must be inserted at the right
time for the side weaving. The location
of the holes in the side rails is
shown in <a href="#Fig257">Fig. 2</a>. The holes in the side
rails may be drilled straight in the
wood.</p>

<p>The pieces may now be nailed together
to form the frame, as shown in
<a href="#Fig257">Fig. 1</a>. If the top of the side rails A
are set about ¹⁄₁₆ in. below the tops of
the posts, the weaving will be almost
level, as the winding reed is thinner
than the round reed. The braces D are
halved at the center, on a slant, to
bring their upper surfaces on a level
when they are in place. The length of
17 in., as given in the material list, is
not accurate, as sufficient length is
given to allow the ends to be cut, in
fitting them in place after the frame is
assembled. The posts should stand
vertical and square. Try the braces before
nailing them in place, to see that
they do not draw the frame out of
shape.</p>

<p>The first operation in weaving is to
cover the tops of the four posts, which
is started as shown in <a href="#Fig257">Fig. 5</a>. A short
piece of winding reed, G, is first tacked
in place. A round reed can be split
if one is careful, in case winding reed
cannot be obtained. Tacks used by
shoemakers are just the thing for fastening
these weavings in place. After
fastening the weaving G in place, another,
H, is put on in an opposite direction,
whereupon J is fastened on the
same as G, and so on, until the post is
covered, as shown in <a href="#Fig257">Fig. 6</a>. Perhaps
a better way to cover the posts would
be to tack all eight pieces on the post
part C, and then weave them down together.
It may not be necessary to
tack them all on the rails.</p>

<p>After the corners are all covered, the
end rails B are wound with the winding
reed, the start being shown in <a href="#Fig257">Fig.
7</a>, where the frame is shown in an inverted
position. The reed is tacked, at
K, to the side rail, and whenever the
winding comes to a hole, a pencil mark
is made to locate the hole later. This
mark is shown at L. When the two
end rails are wound, push a bodkin, or
other steel point, in between the windings
where the marks are located, to
make way for the insertion of the
spokes. It may appear to an observer
that the spokes could be put in before
the winding, but the winding cannot be
properly done after the spokes have
been inserted, as the windings would
separate too much around them. The
hole must be opened up through to the
opposite side of the rail. Single spokes
go through the rail, and they are only
put through one end rail at first, as the
weaving is much easier with one end
of the spokes free, but, of course, they
must be inserted in the other end before
the weaving gets within 2 or 3 in.
of that end. An extra spoke is inserted
beside each spoke, as the weaving proceeds
and after a strip has been woven
³⁄₄ in. wide. These short spokes are cut
just long enough to fit in between the
end rails. The weaving is done with
a single weaver, and it is passed over
and under double spokes as if they
were one. When the weaver comes to
the side rail, it is wound twice around
the rail, to take up the space for the
two strands across. If the weaver does
not go twice around the side rails each
time, either the weaving will take a
curve or the side winding will be loose.
The starting of the weaving is shown
in <a href="#Fig257">Fig. 8</a>, where the extra spokes are
inserted along the side of each spoke
that runs through the end rails.</p>

<p>After the spokes have been inserted
in the opposite end rail and the weaving
in the top completed, the braces
and posts should be wound. Where
the braces D connect to the posts C,
three strips of the winding reed are
passed around the post and tacked on
both sides of the braces, as shown at
M, <a href="#Fig257">Fig. 9</a>. Where the braces cross,
the winding passes around both pieces
for a short distance, as shown at N. It
is quite appropriate to use the brass
caps O on this model, but on many
stools their use has been discontinued
and the winding continues down to
within ¹⁄₈ in. of the bottom of the post.<span class="pagenum" id="Page257">[257]</span>
In case the brass cap cannot be obtained,
the winding may be used also
on this model.</p>

<p class="caption">Details of the Dowel Pieces, Showing
Dimensions for Drilling the Holes to Admit
the Spokes of Reed, Manner of Building the

</div><!--container-->

<p>The side weaving is called the apron,
and in this case the pairing weave is
used. The short spokes will have to
be inserted in the under side of the side
rails, and the extra spokes are added
after the weaving is started and a small
strip woven. The pairing weave is
shown in <a href="#Fig258">Figs. 10, 11, and 12</a>. The two
weavers are represented by the letters
P and Q. The weaver P passes back
of spoke T and out between T and U.
The weaver Q is then used in the same
manner, and so on, around the stool.
When the post is approached the
weaver that comes out between the
last spoke and the post is passed around
the post and in behind the next spoke
on the other side. It will be seen in
the pairing weave that the weaver behind
is always thrown over the other
weaver. This gives the appearance of
a rope twist to the weaving, and also
cinches it to the spokes and prevents
slipping. Always pass the one weaver
around the post twice to take up the
space for the one that cuts across the
corner. The weaving of the sides or
apron is done with the object turned
upside down, where it is in a good position
for finishing off, which is sometimes
called breaking down.</p>

<p>If the weaving has been carried far
enough, the extra spokes are cut off
even with the weaving, and the breaking
down may be done as follows: The
spoke R, <a href="#Fig258">Fig. 13</a>, is shown turned down
back of the spoke S, and S back of T
and out. The spoke R, as shown in
<a href="#Fig258">Fig. 14</a>, is back of S, in front of T,
back of U, and out between U and V,
but as R is brought out, the spoke T
is brought down back and parallel with
R. Likewise the spoke S passes back
of V, and U is brought down with it.
The spoke T is brought back of W and
V is brought down back of it. The
short end of R is inserted under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page258">[258]</span>
roll, between the roll and the weaving,
and is left extending on the inside. If
it is too long, it can be cut off close to
the inside of the weaving. In <a href="#Fig258">Fig. 15</a>,
all the short ends are shown brought
through to the back as far as the weaving
is illustrated. At the corners, the
posts are used as spokes. To finish the
roll, the spokes will have to be inserted
through the roll, to correspond with the
rest of it; hence, the beginning of the
roll should be left loose, as in Fig. 13.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>In weaving, the weavers should be
kept wet, but not the spokes. Do not
put the reed in water and leave it for
any length of time, as it will become
discolored. About 15 minutes will be
sufficient to make the reed pliable, then
it is best to have a sponge and bucket
of water at hand, to dampen long
weavers frequently by drawing the reed
across the wet sponge. Besides being
more workable, the wet reed, held in
place until dry, stays curved in the
form woven much better. Some workmen
leave the reed in water for a long
time and depend on bleaching to
whiten it, but so much of the bleached
work looks like a poor job of painting
that it is much better to keep it white
from the start. In case bleaching is
found necessary, a little chloride of
lime in water makes a good bleacher.
Avoid making the solution too strong.
It should be put on with a brush, so
as to get it into the interstices of the
weaving, whereupon the work is placed
in the sunshine to dry.</p>

<p>Any kind of reed used will have some
of the small hairlike fibers sticking out
after the weaving is complete, and this
should be singed off with a gas flame.
A blowtorch is good for this purpose.
Be careful not to scorch the weaving.</p>

<h2 class="lrgr nobreak">A Homemade Ellipsograph<br>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> J. A. SHELLY</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>The instrument illustrated was designed
to take the place of the two
nails and a piece of string for drawing
ellipses of different sizes. It is made
of hard wood, preferably maple or
beech, and consists of a bar with one
fixed and one sliding head, the latter
having a wedge clamp to hold it at
any point desired on the bar.</p>

<p>In the ends of the heads are driven
two coarse needles that have been
broken off about ⁵⁄₈ in. from the eye
end. These ends should be placed ¹⁄₈
in. from the inside of each head and
the same distance from the bottom, and
driven in until the eyes are each ¹⁄₈ in.
from the surface. A piece of linen
thread is run through the eye of the
needle that is in the end of the sliding
head and knotted to prevent its pulling
out, and the free end is run through
the needle eye on the fixed head. The
thumb tack in the fixed head is to secure
the free end of the thread. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page259">[259]</span>
tack is driven in at an angle so that
one edge sticks up enough to allow the
thread to be pulled under it.</p>

<div class="container w50emmax">

<img src="images/illo263a.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">The Sliding Head can be

<p>To operate the ellipsograph lay out
the length of the major axis on a center
line, then bisect the distance between
these points and erect a perpendicular.
On this line lay off half
the minor axis, measuring from the center
line; then from this point locate
the foci by setting the dividers to half
the major axis and scribing arcs of
circles to cut the center line. Set the
heads of the instrument so that the projecting
needle ends will be the same
distance apart as the foci, and clamp
the sliding head with the wedge. Set
the instrument so that the needle eyes
will be exactly over the points where
the foci are on the center line. A pencil,
with a little groove filed ¹⁄₈ in.
from the point, for the thread to run
in, is set to half the minor axis and the
thread is pulled taut and secured by
the thumb tack. The pencil should be
held perfectly perpendicular while
scribing the line. The instrument must
be reversed to draw the other half of
the ellipse.</p>

<p>To draw an ellipse that will be an
exact projection of a circle at any given
angle it is necessary to determine the
length of the major axis. This may be
done by laying out the circle, either
full size or to scale, and projecting two
parallel lines equal to the diameter of
the circle, or its scale, and connecting
these lines with a line drawn to the required
angle. The length of this line
is the major axis.</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Few persons realize what an intense
heat may be developed when the globe
of an ordinary incandescent lamp is
tightly inclosed, largely eliminating the
loss of heat. When the lamp is inclosed,
the temperature will increase
until the rate of radiation is equal to
that at which the heat is generated. A
good reflector is a poor radiator, hence,
when the metal wall surrounding the
lamp is bright and shiny, both inside
and out, the heat is reflected inward.</p>

<p class="volumereference">[The various materials referred to in this article
by number or size were described in detail in
an article on “A Reed Basket,” in the Boy
Mechanic, Book 2, page 257.]</p>

<p>Footstools of reed are preferable,
in the home, to those made
of other materials, because of their
light weight, rounded edges, and comfortable,
yielding tops. Reed, rattan,
and similar material, used in their construction,
withstand hard wear, and
will not easily mar floors or furniture,
a feature not to be overlooked,
especially since the footstool is a
favorite seat or play table of children.
Several types of stools and foot
rests are shown in the illustration.
A stool having a framework of dowels,
covered with reed, and utilizing the
frame to produce a paneled effect,
is shown in <a href="#Fig263">Fig. 3</a>. The upper
dowel of the framework is covered
and woven over with the top, in
the somewhat lighter stool shown in
<a href="#Fig263">Fig. 8</a>; the legs are braced at the ends
with reed, arched and covered with
winding reed. The stool shown in
<a href="#Fig263">Fig. 11</a> is designed with rounded lines,
the bracing dowels being set low, and
a panel of openwork woven into the
sides. <a href="#Fig263">Figure 15</a> shows a foot rest, the
framework of which is steamed and
bent, and the top slanted to provide a
more comfortable rest for the feet. It
is strongly braced, paneled on the sides
with winding reed, and ornamented
with openwork scrolls. The details of
the construction of the frames and the
method of weaving the reed are shown
in the other sketches.</p>

<p>Dowels, ³⁄₄ in. in diameter, are used
for the main framework of all of the
stools shown. The dimensions of the
various stools may be made to suit
individual taste, those suggested in
each instance having been found satisfactory.
A good size for the stool
shown in <a href="#Fig263">Fig. 3</a> is: height, 9 in.; width,
11 in.; length, 15 in. The lower of the
horizontal dowels should be set at
least one-third the height of the leg
from the top. The braces are notched
at their ends to fit the curve of the
legs, and finishing nails are driven into
them through the legs. The corner
joints are further reinforced by a binding
of reed, placed over them. The
holes for the spokes are bored through
the braces before the construction is
nailed together. They should be bored
about 1¹⁄₄ in. apart, spaced uniformly,
according to the length and width of
the stool. The tops of the legs should
project about ¹⁄₁₆ in. above the upper
braces, so as to produce a level surface
when the winding reed is applied.</p>

<p>The upper end of the legs must first
be covered with winding reed, as
shown in <a href="#Fig263">Fig. 2</a>. Tack a strip of the
reed on; then add successive pieces,
as shown, until the end is covered. The
joint of the leg and the lower brace
must be reinforced, as shown in Fig. 2,
by tacking winding reed over it horizontally.
The braces must then be
wound with winding reed, the spokes
being inserted later. In winding the
reed on the braces, tack one end of it
to the brace at the left of a leg; then
begin the winding on the brace to the
right of the leg, and as each hole is encountered
mark with pencil on the reed,
so that if any of the holes are covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page262">[262]</span>
they may be found easily, when inserting
the spokes. The marks should be
made on the lower side.</p>

<p>The spokes extend from the lower
edge of the bottom rail on one side to
the lower edge of the corresponding
rail or brace on the opposite side. Short
spokes are fitted between the upper
and lower rails at the ends of the stool.
The top is woven complete before the
sides are woven, the pairing weave
being used. In this method two strands
of reed are handled together, the first
passing behind one spoke, and being
below the second strand, and then passing
in front of the next spoke, and
being above the second strand, etc.
This weave is shown in detail in <a href="#Fig271">Fig. 9</a>,
illustrating an <a href="#Page269">article</a> on “Taborets and
Small Tables for the Summer Veranda,”
page 155, July, 1916. The weaving
of the top includes the covering of the
upper rails at the ends of the stool,
which are wound in as spokes, the reed
passing around them and being directed
back in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The weaving for the sides is carried
around the stool continuously, passing
around the legs. One of the strands
in the pairing weave passes behind the
leg, and the other must be wound
around it an extra turn, to cover up the
space otherwise exposed. The reed is
wound around the legs to the lower
end, the strand being tacked at the
inner side of the leg.</p>

<p>The framework for the second type
of stool is shown in <a href="#Fig263">Fig. 6</a>. The two
side rails are fixed into place by the
same method used in making the first
stool, and the frame is braced on the
ends by sections of No. 12 or No. 14
reed. These are fitted into place and
covered in the winding. The braces
should be fitted to the curve of the
leg, and nailed into place with small
finishing nails. The ends where the
braces join the legs and rails should
be whittled down to a long, thin wedge,
so that they may be bound in securely
by the reed that is wound around the
legs, as shown in <a href="#Fig263">Fig. 4</a>.</p>

<p>The spokes in this model, as shown
in <a href="#Fig263">Fig. 6</a>, do not pass through the
upper rails, but extend from one lower
rail over the upper rails and to the
lower rail on the opposite side. This
makes it necessary that the upper rails
be set slightly below and in from the
top and outer edges of the legs. The
lower rails should then be set in so as
to be uniform with the upper ones.</p>

<p>The lower rails and the end braces
are wound by the method used for the
rails in the first stool. The tops of
the legs are finished differently, however,
as shown in <a href="#Fig263">Figs. 4</a> and <a href="#Fig263">5</a>. The
weaving is begun at the lower rail, and
proceeds until the side panel is filled
to the under edge of the upper rail.
The weavers cannot then be returned
at the corner, and are cut off to extend
2 in. beyond the leg. Their ends are
thinned out, and then brought around
the corner against the upper rail on
the end, as shown in Fig. 5. Alternately
they are turned down on the
leg and against the end rail, producing
a covering for the corner. The
strands of the top are woven over the
thinned-out ends, and bound over the
joint of the braces with the upper rail.
The corners may be beaten gently with
a block of wood to smooth them, and
to bring the weavers firmly together.
The weavers pass twice around the
legs, as each strand is brought to the
leg, as shown in <a href="#Fig263">Figs. 5</a> and <a href="#Fig263">7</a>. It
will be found convenient to place the
spokes in only one lower rail, as in
<a href="#Fig263">Fig. 6</a>, while weaving the first side
panel, and the top. As the work proceeds
the spokes are bound down to
the upper end rails, and when the middle
of the second side panel is reached,
they are trimmed off and fitted into
their holes, on that side.</p>

<p>The third stool differs fundamentally
from the preceding ones in that
the framework is curved at the upper
ends, and the weaving of the top is
carried down over the ends. The framework
is shown in detail, in <a href="#Fig263">Fig. 9</a>. Ash
dowels, ³⁄₄ in. in diameter, are used for
the framework, and the rails are
notched into the main sections, and
nailed, as were those in the preceding
stools. The length of the curved dowels
must be determined carefully, and it is
desirable to have the stock longer than
is necessary for the finished pieces,
so that inaccuracies in bending may be
allowed for properly. The distance
between the legs should be such that
a space of ¹⁄₂ in. is provided between
the legs and the first hole for the side
spokes, and the intervening spokes
should be placed 1 in. apart. A satisfactory
size is to make the stool 6 in.
high, the end rails 8 in., and the side
rails 13 inches.</p>

<p class="caption justbordered">The Making of Stools in Woven Reed Affords the Craftworker an Excellent Opportunity
to Produce Constructions, for Home Use, or as Gifts, That Have Originality
and a Personal Element. The Frameworks for Four Typical Stools and Foot
Rests are Shown at the Left, and the Completed Objects at the Right. Figure 14
Shows a Variation Adaptable to the Methods of Weaving Shown in Other Models</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page264">[264]</span></p>

<p>The method of bending the dowels is
shown in <a href="#Fig263">Figs. 12 and 13</a>. They must
be soaked in hot water or steamed, and
clamped around the form as indicated,
being left to dry. A pipe fitted over
the ends of the dowels, to give leverage,
will aid in bending them. The form is
made by fitting pegs, suitably spaced,
into a board, ⁷⁄₈ in. or more in thickness.
The curved pieces may be braced
temporarily, as shown, and removed
from the form when partly dried, so
that it can be used quickly for the second
piece. The pegs must be set close
enough together so that the curve at
the upper ends of the legs will not be
too large, making the legs appear short.
Care must be taken in bending this
short curve, as the dowels are likely
to break if the curve is quite abrupt.
By setting the pegs solidly and making
them long enough, two pieces of dowel
rod may be curved in the form at the
same time, and permitted to dry. A
convenient tray of galvanized iron, for
use in heating water for the moistening
of the dowels, is shown in <a href="#Fig263">Fig. 10</a>.
It is 28 in. long, but may be made
shorter if the points at which curves
are to be made are moistened separately.
A wash boiler, or any other
suitable vessel, may be used for heating
the water and dipping the dowels into
it. After being shaped, the pieces are
trimmed off to the proper height on the
leg portions. Holes for the spokes are
then bored through the lower and side
rails, and they are notched and nailed
to the legs.</p>

<p>The cross rails of the framework,
shown in <a href="#Fig263">Fig. 9</a>, are fixed into place by
the method used in the previous
models. The lower rails should be set
about 2 in. from the floor, and are
bored for double spokes. The rails are
set with their outer edges ¹⁄₈ in. in
from the edges of the legs, so that the
weaving will be flush with the surface
of the legs, rather than project slightly
beyond it. The spokes for the ends
and seat, or top, pass from one lower
rail on one end to the corresponding
rail on the other end, and are supported
on the upper end rails. There
are no corners to be fitted with the
winding reed in this model, as the
windings continue over the curves at
the ends and down over the latter, by
the same method of weaving as used
in the top. The weaving is begun at
the lower rails, and passes completely
around the sides and ends of the stool,
until about 1¹⁄₂ in. has been covered, up
from the lower rails. The ends only
are then covered, the strands of reed
passing around the curved portion of
the upper rails, and around the dowels
forming the support for the top, in
weaving back and forth.</p>

<p>The ornamental weaving at the sides
of the stool is produced by spreading
out the double spokes and conducting
them to the proper holes in the upper
rails. Several types of design may be
made by crossing the spokes in various
ways before setting them into the holes
in the rails. The short spokes in the
sides are permitted to remain with their
upper ends free and longer than necessary
while the 1¹⁄₂-in. lower section is
woven. They must be cut carefully
to the size necessary to form the desired
design, and the ends glued into
the holes.</p>

<p>The stool shown in <a href="#Fig263">Fig. 15</a> is designed
as a foot rest, with a slanting
top. It is similar in general construction
to that shown in <a href="#Fig263">Figs. 9 and 11</a>,
the framework being made of dowels,
bent to the shape indicated by means
of a form. The top and ends are woven
in the manner described for the previous
model. A point of difference to
be noted is the bracing by means of a
woven panel below the side rails, as
shown in Fig. 15. This feature may
be carried around the ends also, or the
ends may be braced to the lower side
panel by the method of bracing shown<span class="pagenum" id="Page265">[265]</span>
in <a href="#Fig263">Fig. 4</a>. The rails around the stool
are all on the same level. The double
spokes for the top are fixed into the
end rails, the spokes for the side panels
into the side rails, and the smaller
dowel placed at the lower edge of the
side panels, as a support for the twisted
weaving shown. The weaving of the
top and the panels is by the method
used in the previous model. The scrolls
fitted into the open portions of the
sides are tacked into place, and the
strands of weaving reed carried over
them, where the curves touch the upper
and lower rails. A variety of designs
may be worked out for the openwork.
The scrolls are made of No. 6 or No. 8
reed, and should be formed on a base,
as in <a href="#Fig263">Fig. 12</a>, brads being used to hold
them in shape until dry.</p>

<p>Another type of foot rest with a
slanting top is shown in <a href="#Fig263">Fig. 14</a>. The
framework is built up of dowels,
straight sections only being used. The
joints are fastened by the method used
in the first and second models described.
The method of covering the
frame is essentially the same as for
the stool shown in <a href="#Fig263">Fig. 15</a>, or an adaptation
of that used in <a href="#Fig263">Fig. 11</a> may also
be applied. Where facilities for steaming
or moistening the dowels are not to
be had conveniently, this type of construction
will be found satisfactory, the
designs being limited to straight lines,
however. The method of covering the
framework used in <a href="#Fig263">Fig. 3</a> is also available
for the framework shown in <a href="#Fig263">Fig.
4</a>, and the corners may be finished as
shown in <a href="#Fig263">Fig. 2</a>. Numerous variations
and combinations of the types shown
may be worked out readily after one
has become reasonably familiar with
the possibilities of woven-reed construction.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The lathe is prepared as an index for
the ratchet wheels by dividing the face
of one of the steps, preferably the largest
of the cone pulley. A center punch
may be used in marking the graduations
slightly, and another point should
be marked in the headstock base, from
which dividers are used to gauge the
movement of the spindle. The dividers
should be set, when the work is begun
so that one point rests in the punch
mark on the headstock and the other
in one of the marks on the pulley. The
bearings should be tightened so that
the work will not shift easily. The
blank to be cut is supported on an
arbor provided with a shoulder, and is
held in place by a small machine screw
threaded into the end of the arbor.</p>

<p>The teeth are cut by filing them with
the gauge as a guide. If the spindle is
turned carefully so that the dividers
register the graduations precisely, the
ratchet wheel will be cut accurately.
By first roughing out the teeth and
then refiling them with a fine file, a
more smoothly finished surface will result.
Other forms of teeth might also
be made if a properly shaped gauge is
provided.—Charles F. Merrill, Hopedale,

2 in. in diameter and ¹⁄₄ in. thick, sawed
from a convenient limb; a twig, 4 in.
long, somewhat smaller than a lead

<p>It is often desirable to concentrate

a limited area
rather than
spreading them,
as is the case
with many lamps
of this type. The
addition of a
hood, which may

the light in this manner. A
strip of sheet brass, about ¹⁄₃₂ in. thick,
4 in. long, and ³⁄₄ in. wide, was drilled
at the center, forming an opening of
the same diameter as the lens. A brass
tube was soldered to fit over the hole.
The ends of the strip were bent back
at right angles, to hold the device
firmly against the sides of the flash
lamp. The lamp is used in the ordinary
fashion, and the clip may be removed
quickly when not needed. It

<h2 class="nobreak">Loading Box to Dispense with
Dark Room</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>When a daylight developing tank is
used, a dark room is needed only for
loading the plate holders and for transferring
exposed plates to the tank.
These operations may be performed
satisfactorily in darkness, using a large
box with holes made in the side to admit
the hands, as shown in the sketch.
The box may be made of light wood
or stout cardboard. The sleeves fitted
to the openings are provided with elastic
bands to insure that no light creeps
in at the edges. The holders, plates,
and sponge should be arranged conveniently
in the box before beginning
operations.</p>

<p class="caption">A Dark Room Is Unnecessary for the Loading of
Plates When the Device Shown is Used</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The box must be made light-proof
by lining it with black cloth if necessary.
If any difficulty is experienced
in identifying the film side of the plates
they may be marked with minute tabs
at the corner on the film side, or identified
by moistening the finger tip on
the sponge and testing for a slight
stickiness of the film side at the extreme
corner. A red window might
be fitted into the box, but the device
has been found satisfactory without it.—Contributed

<p class="volumereference">[The various materials referred to in this article
by number or size were described in detail in
an article on “A Reed Basket,” in the Boy
Mechanic, Book 2, page 257.]</p>

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">U</span><span class="afterlargecap">tility</span> and ready portability are
well recognized features of woven-reed
furniture, but the qualities which
make it especially attractive for summer
use in the open air, or on the veranda,
are its inviting comfort and
graceful lines. While furniture of this
type arranged in suites makes a particularly
harmonious showing, individual
pieces may be used in combination
with other furniture, lending a
touch of variety. Small tables or taborets,
of light weight and simple design,
may be made by the novice, and may
be adapted to a variety of uses. Footstools,
jardinière stands, sewing tables,
yard tables, and smoking stands are
some of the possibilities. Three representative
types are shown in <a href="#Fig271">Figs. 1 to
3</a>, and the general method of construction
as well as the details of the weaving
are also <a href="#Fig271">illustrated</a>.</p>

<p>A serviceable taboret or stand is illustrated
in <a href="#Fig271">Fig. 1</a>. It is 18 in. high,
and 17 in. in diameter on the top. The
sides are 9 in. wide at the top and 14
in. at the bottom.</p>

<p>The framework for the top of the
stand consists of a disk of wood, 16 in.
in diameter, with a similar one, 14 in.
in diameter, directly underneath, the
edge being set under 1 in. all around.
Four legs of 1-in. doweling support it,
and two cross braces of doweling are
placed between diagonally opposite
corner posts, behind the woven portions
of the side. The grain of the
wood in the upper disk should run at
right angles to that of the lower, to
prevent warping, and the disks should
be fastened together with nails or
screws. Avoid putting them into the
lower disk, where the legs are to be
fixed.</p>

<p>To locate the position for the legs,
draw a diameter on the under side of
the top, as at A, <a href="#Fig271">Fig. 4</a>, and 4 in. on
either side of it draw parallel lines B
and C. Draw another diameter, D, at
right angles to A, and draw the parallel
lines E and F 4 in. from the diameter
D. Where the four outside lines intersect
will be the centers of the holes for
the legs. These holes are not bored
perpendicularly, but are slanted to conform
to the slant of the leg. A template
should be used in guiding the bit, as
shown at G, Fig. 4. It may be constructed
of wood, 3 in. wide and 5 in.
long, <a href="#Fig271">Fig. 5</a>. Place the gauge just outside
the edge of the hole to be bored.
Nail it to the board lightly on the diagonal,
as shown, and guide the bit
against it.</p>

<p>Before the legs are fixed into place
finally, the holes for the spokes of the
side should be bored. The parallel
lines of <a href="#Fig271">Fig. 4</a> now serve another purpose,
that of giving the location of the
spokes. Place one spoke ¹⁄₂ in. from
each leg, and the others 1 in. apart.
The legs are utilized as spokes in the
weaving. The spokes should be double,
and the extra spokes may be inserted
beside the original ones, after
the weaving has progressed a few
rounds. Number 5 reed should be
used for the spokes and No. 4 reed for<span class="pagenum" id="Page270">[270]</span>
the weavers, which are woven back
and forth around the spokes.</p>

<p>Drive the legs into their sockets, applying
glue, and pin them with nails, as
at H, <a href="#Fig271">Fig. 4</a>. Tack strips on the bottoms
of two pairs of legs and then
fasten two strips to brace them, as
shown in <a href="#Fig271">Fig. 6</a>. The strips should be
put on and the distance between the
legs spaced before the glue sets.</p>

<p>It is best to weave the sides before
beginning the top, so as to prevent rubbing
the woven top while weaving the
sides, with the stand inverted. The
side spokes should be 2 ft. long and
should be set into the top 1 in., with
glue. Turn the top of the stand down
on a table, and begin the weaving at
the under side of the top. Single weaving
is used for the sides, every other
round passing twice around the legs.</p>

<p>There being four sides in the construction,
there will be an even number
of spokes, even though there should be
an odd number to each side. The weaving
would thus repeat itself, in going
behind and before the same spoke each
time. This is not desirable in this construction,
and a change should be made
each round. To do this, go over two
spokes, instead of one, at the finish of
a round. Such a “skip” is an Indian
method, and forms a design that may
be carried in slanting lines back and
forth down the side of the stand. It
is best to confine these “skips” to one
side. Another way to overcome the repeat,
as the weaving in and out around
the same spokes in two successive layers
is called, is to insert an extra spoke
on one side, thus making an odd number
of spokes around the stand. It is
necessary then to conform the design
of the open work for this side to the
number of spokes. The design for the
open work shown in <a href="#Fig271">Fig. 2</a> will be used
for the stand illustrated in <a href="#Fig271">Fig. 1</a>, and
to be described in detail. The first of
the two methods of overcoming the
“repeat” will be used.</p>

<p>Insert the extra reed for doubling
the spokes, after a few rounds have
been woven adjoining the top. The
method of weaving from the corner
post and the making of the open design
are shown in <a href="#Fig271">Figs. 7 and 8</a>. The
method of “pairing” for winding the
reed in and out of the spokes, is shown
in <a href="#Fig271">Figs. 9 and 10</a>. The rear weaver of
the pair of strands is thrown over the
forward weaver, back of the next spoke
and out. The fore weaver then becomes
the rear one, and is thrown in
like manner. This process is repeated
in order to make the complete rounds.
Figure 9 shows the weaving from the
side, and Fig. 10 is a view looking
down on top of the spokes and the edge
of the weaving, shown in section. Pairing
gives a continuous rope twist to
the two weavers, and an even or odd
number of spokes is equally suitable.</p>

<p>For the open designs of <a href="#Fig271">Fig. 2</a>, one
or more of which may be placed in the
side of the stand, the center spokes are
left free, as shown in <a href="#Fig271">Fig. 7</a>. Before
turning the first weaver back for the
open work, as at M, start a short
weaver N about two spokes back from
the opening, and pair it with the regular
weaver across the opening, and two
spokes beyond. In turning back on the
spokes, the single weaver goes twice
around the spokes, as shown by the
intermediate layers O. This is a short
bend and the weavers must be very
soft. Use short ones and wet them frequently
with a sponge. A sectional
view of the weaving at the opening is
shown in <a href="#Fig271">Fig. 8</a>, as it joins with the
weaving around the corner posts. At K,
the weaver turns back on a double thickness
of reed, and at L, a short spoke is
set back of the other two, and the
weaver is wound around the three, thus
lessening the abruptness of the winding.
The latter method is the better.
At the horizontal center of the opening,
two rounds continue across the
opening and around the stand. Pair a
short piece of reed across at the finish
of the openings, as was done at the
lower end at N, Fig. 7.</p>

<p>After weaving to within 5 in. of the
bottom of the legs, cut off the extra
member of the double spokes, and soak
the ends of the remaining spokes in
water. Braid them into the border finish,
as shown in <a href="#Fig271">Fig. 1</a>. The corner
posts serve as spoke spaces, and the
spokes nearest them are wound around
the bottom ends of the legs. Short
spokes may be inserted beside the posts
and wound around them if the ends of
the spokes are not long enough for this
purpose.</p>

<p class="caption long">Taborets, of Light Weight and Simple Design, may be Made by the Novice and Adapted to a Variety
of Uses in the Home. They Are Particularly Attractive for the Summer Veranda. Sewing Tables,
Jardinière Stands, Taborets, Footstools, Card Tables, and Smoking Stands Are Some of the Possibilities.
A Taboret, or Small Stand, is Illustrated in Fig. 1, and the Details of Its Construction are Also
Shown. The Tall Stand illustrated in Fig. 2 Involves the Same General Principles of Construction, Modified
to Suit the Framework. The Footstool Shown in Fig. 3 Is Typical of Stands Having Vertical Sides</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page272">[272]</span></p>

<p>The top may be made next. Holes
are bored horizontally into the edge of
the under disk, as shown in <a href="#Fig271">Figs. 4
and 11</a>. In <a href="#Fig271">Fig. 12</a> the holes are shown
bored into the edge on an angle. This
method gives a thicker rolled edge to
the top, although both methods are
satisfactory. These holes must be
bored before the work on the top is
begun. There are two ways of beginning
the weaving for the top. The
radial spokes may cross each other in
groups of four, the upper and lower
courses being bound together with
winding reed, as shown in <a href="#Fig271">Fig. 13</a>, or
a small maple disk may be used as a
center from which the spokes radiate,
as shown in <a href="#Fig271">Figs. 14 and 20</a>. The center-disk
method is not difficult, and is
used extensively. The other type is
novel, and also quite feasible.</p>

<p>The spokes for the method shown in
<a href="#Fig271">Fig. 13</a> are bound together in the following
manner: Place two spokes at
right angles to each other and wind
them with winding reed, the end of the
latter beginning between the two
spokes, as shown at P, <a href="#Fig271">Fig. 15</a>. The
perpendicular spoke is uppermost. Add
a second perpendicular spoke and bind
it into place, as at Q. Continue this
process until four perpendicular spokes
have been bound in as at R. Place a
second horizontal reed into position
and go over each vertical spoke with
a separate winding, as in the first
course. Continue until four horizontal
spokes are bound in, and the end of
the winding reed is looped around the
last, as shown at S. The spokes should
be of No. 5 reed, and 24 in. long.</p>

<p>Four groups of four spokes each will
result by following out the process described.
Separate the spokes by drawing
the outer ones into the corner
spaces. They should have the appearance
of spokes in a wheel, as in <a href="#Fig271">Fig. 16</a>.
Use two weavers of No. 4 reed, in the
pairing weave, as shown in Fig. 16, and
in detail in <a href="#Fig271">Figs. 9 and 10</a>. Continue
the pairing weave until a center, 8 in.
in diameter, is woven. Crowd up the
weaving closely, for the appearance of
the top will depend much on the first
few rounds. Hold the center with the
left hand, and manipulate the weavers
until they are well seated in their
proper places.</p>

<p>When a few rounds have been
woven, nail the center securely to its
place on the middle of the top. This
will leave both hands free for the weaving.
After a disk, 8 in. in diameter,
has been woven, begin the triple weave
illustrated in <a href="#Fig271">Figs. 17 and 18</a>. As the
triple weave is begun, add another
spoke, 8 in. long, between each pair, all
around the top, making 16 new and 16
original spokes. When two or three
rounds are woven, the new spokes will
become secure. Continue the triple
weave to the edge of the top. Measure
and cut the end of the spokes to uniform
length. Curve the ends over the
edge to see how much will be needed
before cutting, allowing about ¹⁄₂ in.
for insertion into the holes in the edge.</p>

<p>Wet the ends of the spokes with water
until they are pliable enough for
the curve. Bending and tying them
down while wet and permitting them
to dry in this position, as shown in <a href="#Fig271">Fig.
19</a>, is desirable also. Weave down the
curve of the roll and insert the ends of
the spokes in their respective holes
with glue. Then with the single, plain
weave on the under side of the roll,
weave well up to the ends of the spokes.</p>

<p>For the disk-center method of construction,
as shown in <a href="#Fig271">Figs. 14 and 20</a>,
use ¹⁄₂-in. maple, and cut it 5 in. in
diameter for the centerpiece. To locate
holes on the edge of the disk draw a
line ³⁄₁₆ in. from the upper edge and
mark off spaces 1 in. apart, except four,
which are made ¹⁵⁄₁₆ in. apart, to make
a convenient division, practically uniform.
Bore the holes ³⁄₄ in. deep.
Number 5 reed is used for the spokes
and No. 4 reed for the weavers. The
disk should be toenailed around its
edge with brads, fixing it firmly to the
top before the spokes are inserted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page273">[273]</span>
Proceed with the pairing weave, as in
the other method described, until 2 in.
of the spokes is covered; then change
to the triple weave and add additional
spokes. Proceed as with the other type
from this point on.</p>

<p>The taboret is braced by two 1-in.
dowel rods, placed 2 in. above the bottom
roll of the sides and extending
from one corner to the other, diagonally.
Their crossing at the center may
be made into a halved joint, by cutting
away one-half of each rod on the adjacent
edges. The ends are fitted closely
into the corners, and are nailed to the
legs.</p>

<p>A taller stand or small table, the side
weaving of which has been described
as applied to the taboret shown in <a href="#Fig271">Fig.
1</a>, is illustrated in <a href="#Fig271">Fig. 2</a>. The construction
in general is similar. A lighter roll
is used for the top, and the bottom
ends of the legs are curved outward
slightly. The legs are curved by steaming
the ends of the corner posts, clamping
them into position, and permitting
them to dry.</p>

<p>The footstool, shown in <a href="#Fig271">Fig. 3</a>, may
be made as a miniature stand, with
vertical legs, and the spokes set in a
circle under the top board. The spokes
and weavers will carry the form, if well
woven. The stool may also be braced,
to withstand hard usage. It should be
about 12 in. in diameter at the top, 10
in. in diameter for the body, and 6 in. in
height.</p>

<p>The method of forming the opening
shown in the side of the taboret in <a href="#Fig271">Fig.
1</a>, and the weaving of the construction,
will be readily understood from the
method described. The principles and
methods presented may be applied
readily to other construction of the
same general type. The physical limitations
of reed, as a constructive material,
and the necessity for a substantial
framework must always be considered
in such adaptations in order to
obtain satisfactory results.</p>

<p>Aquatic pleasures and sports at a

at a boys’ summer camp at Crystal
Lake, Ill. The boys have made a practice
for several years of building a
tower early each swimming season on
the opening of their camp in July and
disposing of it for about $5 at the close
of the camp some weeks later. This
covers the cost of the lumber, and
several resorts and cottages now boast
towers made by the campers.</p>

<p>The main section was made of a piece
of 1¹⁄₂-in. angle iron, 10 in. long. The
flukes, or endpieces, were made of sheet
iron, 2 in. wide and 8 in. long, bent at
a right angle, and riveted in place. The
straps which hold the link, permitting
it to swing freely, were made of band
iron. The link was made of an old
bicycle crank, into which a ring was
forged. It may be made of iron rod,
forged into the desired shape and fitted
with a ring. A convenient method of
handling the anchor on a boat is to
run the line through a pulley at the
bow and fasten the end of it to a cleat,
near the seat of the person handling
the craft. Care must be taken, in a
canoe or small boat, that sufficient line
is provided to reach the bottom of the
anchorage, as otherwise the craft may
be overturned.—Contributed by B. E.

<span class="partname">PART I—A Twine Hammock</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">C</span><span class="afterlargecap">ord</span> hammocks may be made in
two or more different ways, the
knots being formed by the simple overhand
tie, <a href="#Fig278">Fig. 1</a>; the flat reef knot, <a href="#Fig278">Fig.
2</a>; the Solomon’s knot, <a href="#Fig278">Fig. 3</a>, or by the
triple throw-over, <a href="#Fig278">Fig. 4</a>; or they can
be knotted by the process known as
netting, <a href="#Fig278">Fig. 5</a>, in which a special
needle, or shuttle, is used.</p>

<div class="container w30emmax">

<img src="images/illo281.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">When Making a Hammock With the Simple Overhand, Flat
Reef, or Solomon’s Knot, Loop All the Pairs
of Cords at the Center about a Rod</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>In using any one of the first three
methods of making the knots it is necessary
to have cords arranged in pairs
and long enough to
reach from
one end of the
hammock to
the other, allowing
only
sufficient
length for the
take-up in tying
the knots
and the spread
of the meshes.
The overhand
knot is large,
and the Solomon’s
knot is a little
unwieldy, but
is considered
more beautiful
when tied.
The flat reef
knot is small,
is easily tied
and will not
slip. The netting
process has a good knot
and has the advantage of a short
single cord, as the meshes are made independently
and the cord is carried on
the netting needle.</p>

<p>It is a great advantage, when making
a hammock with the simple overhand,
the flat reef, or the Solomon’s knot, to
loop all the pairs of cords at the
center about a rod, <a href="#Fig279a">Fig. 6</a>—which may
be any stick such as an old broom
handle—knotting from the center toward
each end, one side being tied, and
then the other. When the first pairs
are being tied, the opposite ends should
be looped up together out of the way.
Even half the length of a hammock
makes a long cord to be drawn through
each time a knot is tied, and each string
can be wound about the fingers into a
little bundle and secured with a half
hitch, using the same cord, and left
hanging, as shown in <a href="#Fig279a">Fig. 7</a>, allowing
sufficient cord free to throw large loops
in the tying,
and to make
about 10 additional
meshes.
About 3 ft.
would be a
good length
to be left free.</p>

<p>It will be
necessary to
have 24 pairs
of cords—48
cords in all—each
18 ft.
long to make a
hammock by
the first two
methods of
tying the
knots. Seine
twine of medium-hard
twist and 24-ply
can be obtained
from a
store carrying
sporting
goods, and is
about the best
material to use for this purpose.
When these pairs of cords are looped
on the center rod, and the rod has been
anchored to a wall, as shown in <a href="#Fig279a">Fig. 8</a>,
begin by placing the mesh stick, or
rather the mesh post, <a href="#Fig279a">Fig. 9</a>, between
the first pair of cords, A and B, at the
left end of the center rod, as in Fig. 8
and <a href="#Fig279a">Fig. 6</a>. The simple device illustrated
in Fig. 9 is very useful for tying
any one of the three first-described<span class="pagenum" id="Page278">[278]</span>
knots. The device needs no explanation
other than the illustration. It will
be seen that there are two sizes on the
top of the post; the smaller is for the
first time across only. The mesh post
should be of convenient height for a
person when sitting on an ordinary
chair. One foot rests on the base as
the tying proceeds, but there is no pulling
over, as the tie draws both ways
on the post, this also doing away with
the pull on the center rod.</p>

<p class="caption">The Simple Overhand, Flat Reef, Solomon’s Knot,
Triple Throw-Over, and Netting Ties</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The cord to the right, B, is taken in
the right hand and thrown over the
left cord A, <a href="#Fig279a">Fig. 8</a>, and is held by the
left hand. The left cord A is then
tucked down behind the right, as
shown in <a href="#Fig279a">Fig. 10</a>. If the right cord
goes over in making the first loop, the
same cord B must also go over in the
second throw, as in <a href="#Fig279a">Fig. 11</a>, in order
to have a proper square knot that will
not slip. The end of A is then tucked
under B, as shown by the dotted lines.
This makes a very serviceable knot for
the hammock, but can be also used for
other purposes. The knot is shown in
<a href="#Fig278">Fig. 2</a>. Draw it up tightly, very hard,
for knotting is not worth much if it is
not tied well.</p>

<p>In case the simple overhand knot is
preferred, the mesh post is placed between
the first pair as before, and cords
A and B are brought to the front as in
<a href="#Fig279b">Fig. 12</a>, but are carried parallel into a
large loop that is thrown over as illustrated,
then tucked up through as indicated
by the dotted lines. The thumb
and first finger of the left hand now
slide up to the point P, while the right
hand pulls up the loop as it nears the
finish, the thumb and first finger crowding
the loop down hard against the
mesh post. The small part is used for
the first row across. The knot formed
is shown in <a href="#Fig278">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">The Mesh Post Has Two Sizes on Its Upper End, the Smaller for Knotting the First Row of Meshes, and
the Other for the Remaining Rows. This Illustration Also Shows the Manner of Tying the Knots</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>After tying the first pair of cords
using the knot preferred, slip the first
mesh so made off the tying post and
place the post between C and D, which
is the next, or second, pair. Tie the
second pair and pass on to the third
pair, which is E and F. Continue moving
and tying until all the 24 pairs of
cords have been similarly knotted in
their first mesh. The last knotting will
be the twenty-fourth pair, which is represented
by the cords marked Y and Z.
Instead of tying cords of the same pairs
on the return trip across, one cord Y of
the twenty-fourth pair is tied with one
cord X of the twenty-third pair, and
the other cord W of the twenty-third
pair is tied with the cord V of the
twenty second pair, and so on across
the series.</p>

<p>On the second row of tying, the post
is first placed between cords Y and X
and they are knotted together, but instead
of tying about the small part of
the post the larger size is used. After
cords Y and X have been tied, cords
W and V are combined. It will be seen
that this is tying the pairs together instead
of combining the two cords of the
same pair. The third time across the
combinations are the same as in the
first row. The large mesh is used on<span class="pagenum" id="Page279">[279]</span>
all but the first row. The alternations
of rows is continued until the cords are
tied to within 2¹⁄₂ ft. of the end.</p>

<p class="caption">Tying the Overhand Knot and How to Run the First
and Second Rows Across</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Pull out the center rod, insert it in
the second row of meshes, loosen the
ends that were looped up and begin the
knotting of the opposite ends of the
cords. When both sides are completed
to within 2¹⁄₂ ft. of the ends, the center
rod is removed and inserted in the last
row of meshes. Another simple device
will be found efficient, which consists
of a board, 30 in. long, three or more
inches wide and 1 in. thick, with three
nails driven in slanting, as shown in
<a href="#Fig280a">Fig. 14</a>, to prevent the ring and rod
from slipping off as the tying proceeds.
One 2¹⁄₂-in. galvanized ring will be required
for each end. The ring is attached
to the single nail at the end with
a string. This will be found better
than just slipping the ring over the
nail, as it is necessary to have a little
more play in putting the cords through
for the tying. The distance from the
rod to the ring should be 2 ft. The tie
is made in pairs as before, one cord
going under and the other over the
side of the ring, using the flat reef knot.
There will be a few inches of ends remaining
after the tie is made and these
are brought back to the main body of
the cord and wound with an extra cord
used for that purpose. The winding is
started by looping the end of the extra
cord, or string, about the whole bundle
of cord together with the ends, pulling
tightly and tying securely with the
flat reef knot. This is illustrated in
<a href="#Fig280a">Fig. 15</a>. The winding should be about
1¹⁄₂ in. long where the turned-back ends
are cut off. Each time the cord is
wound about the bundle it should be
looped through its own winding and
drawn tightly. This is practically the
buttonhole loop. To finish the winding
the cord should be given a double looping<span class="pagenum" id="Page280">[280]</span>
through its own winding; then with
an awl, or other pointed tool, work a
way through the under side of the
other windings so that the end may be
brought out farther back and pulled
tightly, to prevent unwinding when the
pull comes on the hammock. Attach
the ring to the opposite end in the
same manner and the hammock is complete.</p>

<p>The edge can be bound the same as a
tennis net, or a rope can be run through

A very pretty effect can be obtained

apron fringe for the sides.</p>

<p class="caption">The Tools Necessary Consist of a Needle or Shuttle,
a Guage Board, and a Mesh Stick</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The equipment for netting a hammock
consists of a wood needle, or
shuttle, a gauge board for the long
meshes at the ends, and a mesh stick
for the regular netting of the main
body of the hammock, all of which will
be described in detail.</p>

<p>The shuttle is made of wood and is
12 in. long, 1¹⁄₄ in. wide, and ¹⁄₄ in.
thick. The best material to use is
maple or other hard wood, but very
satisfactory ones can be cut from good-grained
pine. The sketch, <a href="#Fig282">Fig. 1</a>, shows
the general shape of the shuttle, one
end being pointed and the other
forked. Lay out the pointed end before
beginning to cut down to size.
Place a compass at the center of the
end, and with a radius of 1¹⁄₂ in. describe
the arc AB. With the intersections
of this arc and the side lines
of the needle, C and D, as centers, and
the same radius, 1¹⁄₂ in., cut the arc
AB at E and F. With E and F as centers
draw the curves of the end of the
shuttle. The reason for placing the
centers outside of the shuttle lines is
to obtain a longer curve to the end.
The curves can be drawn free-hand
but will then not be so good.</p>

<p>The space across the needle at GH is
divided into five ¹⁄₄-in. divisions. The
centers of the holes J and K at the base
of the tongue are 3¹⁄₂ in. from the
pointed end. The opening is 2³⁄₄ in.
long. Bore a ¹⁄₄-in. hole at the right
end of the opening, and just to the left
three holes, as shown by the dotted
lines. With a coping saw cut out along
the lines and finish with a knife, file
and sandpaper. Round off the edges
as shown by the sectional detail. It is
well to bevel the curve at L so that
the shuttle will wind easily. The fork
is ³⁄₄ in. deep, each prong being ¹⁄₄ in
wide. Slant the point of the shuttle
and round off all edges throughout and
sandpaper smooth.</p>

<p>The gauge board, <a href="#Fig282">Fig. 2</a>, is used for
making the long meshes at both ends
of the hammock. It is a board about 3
ft. long, 4 in. wide, and 1 in. thick. An
eight-penny nail is driven into the
board 1 in. from the right edge and 2
in. from the end, as shown by M, allowing
it to project about 1 in. and
slanting a little toward the end; the
other nail N will be located later.</p>

<p>The mesh stick, <a href="#Fig282">Fig. 3</a>, should be
made of maple, 8 in. long, 1³⁄₄ in. wide
and ¹⁄₄ in. thick. Round off the edges
and sandpaper them very smooth.</p>

<p>The making of the net by a specially
devised shuttle is called “natting,” or
netting, when done with a fine thread
and a suitably fine shuttle. Much may
be done in unique lace-work designs
and when coarser material and large
shuttles are used, such articles as fish
nets, tennis nets and hammocks may
be made. The old knot used in natting
was difficult to learn and there was a
knack to it that was easily forgotten,<span class="pagenum" id="Page283">[283]</span>
but there is a slight modification of this
knot that is quite easy to learn and
to make The modified knot will be
the one described.</p>

<p>The shuttle is first wound by looping
the cord over the tongue, as shown
in <a href="#Fig283a">Fig. 4</a>, then bringing it down to the
forked end and up to the opening on
the opposite side; then the cord is
again looped over the tongue and returned
to the fork or place of starting.
Continue winding back and forth until
the shuttle is full. The shuttle will
accommodate from 20 to 35 complete
rounds. If the shuttle is too full it
crowds in passing through the meshes
and delays the work.</p>

At a point 2 ft. from the lower edge of

nail, N. Tie the cord end of the shuttle
to the ring, bring the shuttle down
and around the nail N; then bring it
back and pass it through the ring from
the under side. The cord will then appear
as shown. A part of the ring projects
over the edge of the board to
make it easier to pass the shuttle
through. Draw the cord up tightly
and put the thumb on top of the cord
O, <a href="#Fig283a">Fig. 5</a>, to prevent it from slipping
back, then throw a loop of the cord to
the left over the thumb and up over a
portion of the ring and pass the shuttle
under the two taut cords and bring
it up between the thumb and the two
cords, as shown. Draw the looped knot
tight under the thumb. Slip the long
loop off the nail N and tie a simple
knot at the mark P. This last knot is
tied in the long loop to prevent looseness.
Proceed with the next loop as
with the first and repeat until there are
30 long meshes.</p>

<p class="caption">After the Completion of the Long Meshes, the Ring
is Anchored and the Mesh Stick Brought into Use</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>After completing these meshes
anchor the ring by its short cord to a
hook or other stationary object. The
anchorage should be a little above the
level for tying the knots of the net.
Tie the cord of the shuttle to the left
outside loop and always work from the
left to the right; and the first time
across see that the long meshes do not
cross over each other, but are kept in
the order in which they are attached to
the ring.</p>

<p>After tying the cord to the mesh 1,
<a href="#Fig283b">Fig. 6</a>, bring the mesh stick into use.
Pass the cord down over the mesh
stick, drawing the lower end of the
loop down until it comes against the
upper side of the mesh stick and put
the thumb down upon it in this position
to prevent slipping. Pass the shuttle<span class="pagenum" id="Page284">[284]</span>
up through the loop 2 and draw
that down to the mesh stick. Shift the
thumb from the first position to the
second. Throw the cord to the left
over the thumb and about the loop 2,
as shown in <a href="#Fig283b">Fig. 7</a>, and bring the shuttle
under both of the cords of mesh 2
and up between the large backward
loop and the cords of the mesh 2.
Without removing the thumb draw up
the knot very tight. This makes the
first netting knot. Continue the cord
around the mesh stick, pass it up
through mesh 3, throw the backward
loop, put the shuttle under and up to
the left of the mesh 3 and draw very
tight, and do not allow a mesh to be
drawn down below the upper side of
the mesh stick. Some of these cautions
are practically repeated, but if a
mesh is allowed to get irregular, it will
give trouble in future operations.</p>

the cord will be at the left, ready to begin

when the meshes are taken off the stick
but they must all come off before a new

makes it easy to flip the work over.

</div><!--container-->

<p>The first mesh each time across is
just a little different problem from all
the others, which may be better understood
by reference to <a href="#Fig283b">Fig. 8</a>. The knots
Q, R, and S are of the next previous
series. The cord is brought down over
the mesh stick and up through mesh 1,
and when the loop is brought down it
may not draw to the mesh stick at its
center; it is apt to do otherwise and a
sideway pull is necessary, which is
pulled so that the knots Q and R are
side by side, then the knot at T may
be tied. When the mesh 2 is drawn
down it should pull to place without
shifting, and also all the others of that
row.</p>

<p>Continue the use of the mesh stick
until a net 8 ft. long is made. When the
cord gives out rewind the shuttle and
tie with a small knot that will not slip.
The weaver’s knot is good if known, or
the simple square knot shown in <a href="#Fig284a">Fig. 9</a>
is very good. It is too easy to make
to need direction, but unless it is
thrown over just right it will slip. Let
U, <a href="#Fig283b">Fig. 8</a>, represent the short cord and
V the new piece to be added. Place
the cord V back of U and give U a
complete turn around V, Fig. 9, and
bring them together at a point above
U, then to the front. Repeat the complete
turn of U about V, shown by the
dotted line, and pull tightly. If analyzed,
it consists of two loops that are
just alike and linked together as shown
in <a href="#Fig284a">Fig. 10</a>.</p>

<p>When the 8 ft. of netting has been
completed, proceed to make the long
loops as at the beginning. The same
gauge board can be used, but the tying
occurs at both ends, and since the pairs
cannot be knotted in the center, two<span class="pagenum" id="Page285">[285]</span>
or three twists can be given by the
second about the first of each pair.
The long loops and the net are attached
together as shown in <a href="#Fig284b">Fig. 11</a>.
Slip one of the meshes of the last run
over the nail N, and when the cord
comes down from the ring, the shuttle
passes through the same mesh, and
when drawn up, the farthest point of
the mesh comes against the nail. After
this long loop has been secured at the
ring, the first mesh is slipped off and
the next put on. All of the long loops
at this end will be about three inches
shorter than at the other end, unless
the finishing nail N is moved down.
This will not be necessary.</p>

<p>With a piece of cord about six feet
long, start quite close to the ring and
wind all the cords of the long loops
together. The winding should be made
very tight, and it is best to loop under
with each coil. This is shown in
<a href="#Fig284b">Fig. 12</a>.</p>

<p>The hammock is now ready for use.
Some like a soft, small rope run
through the outside edges lengthwise,
others prefer a fringe, and either can
be added. The fringe can be attached
about six meshes down from the upper
edge of the sides. The hammock
should have a stretcher at each end of
the netted portion, but not as long as
those required for web hammocks.</p>

<p>Only three pieces of wood are necessary

necessary except to have the top arm
swing freely up and down without any
appreciable side movement. The carbon
holders are merely strips of heavy
tin, which need only be screwed up
sufficiently tight to hold the carbons
in place and yet permit their being
pushed up when the top adjusting
screw will no longer operate. This adjustment
may be readily taken care of
by means of a long, slender wood screw
with the point filed off and a metal
disk soldered to the top. Connections
are made to the carbon holders either
under a screw head or by soldering the
wires to the metal.</p>

<p>In operating any arc light on the
commercial 110-volt current some resistance
must be placed in the circuit.
An earthen jar of water with two strips

every purpose.</p>

<p>There has been a number of descriptions
telling how to bind magazines,
but none how to trim the edges after
having bound them. Desiring to have
my home-bound volumes appear as
well as the other books, I made a trimmer
as follows:</p>

<p>Any large knife with a straight edge
will do for the cutter. I used a large
hay knife. A ³⁄₈-in. hole was drilled in
the untempered portion near the back
of the handle end. Two U-shaped supports
were made of metal and fastened
to the top of an old table, between
which the knife was fastened with a
bolt. A piece of timber, 6 ft. long, 4 in.
wide, and 2 in. thick, was used as a
lever. One end of this piece had a U-shaped
notch cut in it to straddle the
supports under the projecting ends. A
board was attached to the table top,
having one straight edge set where the
knife edge would just pass it.</p>

<p>If the knife has a good sharp edge
it will do very satisfactory work.
When the edges are trimmed the knife
can be removed and used for its original
work.—Contributed by E. S. Mundell,

<h2 class="nobreak">How to Repair Rubber Gloves</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>While making a bunglesome job of
patching a pair of rubber gloves, which
I used to keep the stains from my
fingers while developing photographic
plates, a physician friend happened
along and told me how to do it properly.
The method is as follows: Procure
a piece of card, such as heavy
Bristol board used for filing cards;
spread it on one side, rather thick, with
ordinary library paste and stick it to
the rubber tissue, preferably dentists’
rubber dam of light weight; smooth it
flat, and let the paste dry. When a
patch is needed cut one out, rubber
and card together, and fit it to the cut
in the glove. Put the glove on the
hand inside out, moisten the patch with
cement, let it dry for a few seconds and
then press it in place hard. If the tear
is large, it is easier to lay the moistened
patch down and fit the edges of the tear
to it, then press hard in place. After
the cement has thoroughly dried out,
soak the patch in water and remove
the bit of card. This gives a patch
fastened securely to the extreme edges;
flat, water-tight, and as fit to stand boiling
as any patch, for sterilizing. After
removing the card, the glove is dusted
with talcum.—Contributed by J. S.

<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> F. E. TUCK</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">B</span><span class="afterlargecap">oys</span> in a manual-training class became
very enthusiastic over the
making of small chestlike boxes, bound
with ornamental metal, and adapted
them to a great variety of uses. The
boxes were designed to suit the taste
of the maker and for use as glove,
handkerchief, jewelry, toilet, treasure
and other boxes, lined with silk, and
finished in wax and varnish, in various
stains. Oak was used for most of
them, and the metals employed were
largely copper and brass, although
silver is suitable for small boxes. They
are simple in construction, as shown
in the <a href="#Fig289">working drawings</a>, and can be
made in the home workshop. The
<a href="#Fig287">photograph</a> reproduced shows a group
of boxes, for various purposes, and in
several styles of metal binding. The
long box at the top is for gloves or
ties; the larger ones are for the boys’
personal use, caring for collars, handkerchiefs,
etc.; the smaller boxes are
for the dresser, providing for the care
of jewelry and similar small articles.
The boxes proved great favorites as
gifts, and the monogram of the recipient
may be etched into the metal.</p>

<div class="container w45emmax" id="Fig287">

<img src="images/illo291.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">These Gift Boxes, Trimmed with Ornamental Metal, were Made by Boys in a Manual-Training Class.
A Long Glove Box is Shown Above; the Larger Boxes Are for Handkerchiefs,
and the Smaller Ones for Jewelry and Trinkets</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Well-seasoned oak is the most suitable
material for the making of the
boxes, as it harmonizes well with the
plain metal trimmings. The quarter-sawed
variety is preferable, being more
ornamental, and less likely to warp
or twist. For most of the boxes, stock
³⁄₈ in. thick is suitable, although this
may be cut down to ⁵⁄₁₆ in. for the
smaller boxes, if convenient. The
method of joining the pieces is similar
in all the varieties of boxes, and the
jewel box illustrated in the <a href="#Fig289">working
drawings</a> will be taken as a specimen.
The sides of the box are butted against<span class="pagenum" id="Page288">[288]</span>
the ends, lapping over them, flush, and
nailed with small brads. The bottom
is fitted between the sides and ends,
and nailed so that the nails are concealed
by the metal bands, at the four
corners, and at other points, if bands
are placed near the middle. The stock
for the box is cut and finished on all
sides to the following dimensions: all
pieces to be ³⁄₈ in. thick; top, 4¹⁄₂ by
7¹⁄₂ in.; two sides, 1⁷⁄₈ by 7 in.; two
ends, 1⁷⁄₈ by 4 in.; bottom, 3¹⁄₄ by
6¹⁄₄ inches.</p>

<p>All the pieces should be scraped carefully
to a smooth finish, and the nails
started with an awl, or a slightly flattened
nail of the same size, fitted into
a hand drill. Extreme care must be
taken, in nailing, that the surface of
the wood is not marred, which is likely
to occur if the nails are driven into the
wood too rapidly, or without starting
holes for them. The feet are cut from
a strip, ³⁄₈ in. thick and ³⁄₄ in. wide, the
cut edges being sandpapered smooth
without destroying the squareness and
the sharp corners. They are nailed to
the bottom of the box with brads, care
being taken to have the end grain of
each block at the end of the box, particularly
if the metal trimmings do
not cover the blocks.</p>

<p>The cover is fixed in place with small
plain butts, countersunk into the wood,
one leaf into the top and the other into
the back of the box. A simpler method
is to set both leaves of the hinge into
the edge of the back. Care must be
taken in fitting the hinges that they are
set in line with the back of the box,
and holes for the screws should be
made before driving them into place.
Too much care cannot be taken with
the fitting of the hinges, as the proper
fitting of the lid, both as to resting
level and being in line with the edges
of the box, depends on the fitting of
the hinges.</p>

<p>After the construction work and
nailing is completed, the box may be
sandpapered carefully, rubbing in the
direction of the grain, and being careful
not to round off the edges unduly.
The oversandpapering of woodwork
marks the work of the careless novice.
The box should be handled as little as
possible while the metal trimmings are
being fitted, and, before the finish is
applied, should be gone over lightly
with sandpaper to remove dirt. When
the metal pieces are fitted, and ready
to be fastened in place, the finish may
be applied to the box. Warm browns
or other dark-oak finishes, are best
suited to the simple style of chest, and
the metal fittings. A coat of stain
should be applied, and this followed,
when dry, by a coat of filler, rubbed
well into the pores of the wood. The
filler should be permitted to dry hard
and the surface is then sandpapered
very lightly with a fine grade of paper—No.
00 is best. Do not rub through
the filler or stain, particularly at the
corners. Wax is the most readily applied
outer finish. Several coats may
be used to give a substantial finish. A
coat of shellac, followed by coats of
rubbing varnish, dried well and rubbed
between coats with No. 00 sandpaper
may be applied for a high-gloss finish.
This is a more involved process and requires
that the varnish be rubbed down
with pumice stone and water, and finished
with an oil polish.</p>

<p>Copper or brass, of No. 20 gauge or
lighter, is suitable for the making of
the trimmings. The details of the
handles are shown in the <a href="#Fig289">sketch</a>, at the
right. Cut a back plate, ⁷⁄₈ in. by 1¹⁄₄
in., and fit the handle of wire to it by
means of a strap, bent from a strip of
metal, ³⁄₈ in. by ⁷⁄₈ in. The other bands
are merely strips, ¹⁄₂ to ³⁄₄ in. in width
and fitted to the size of the box, where
applied. Strap hinges of the same
metal may be made, but the most convenient
method for the amateur is to
fit the metal strips into place at the
hinges, merely as ornamental features.
Various types of locks may be fitted
into the box, and for the worker having
the necessary skill, it is interesting to
make a hasp, as indicated in the sketch.</p>

<p>The designing and making of the
metal trimmings affords unlimited opportunity
for originality, and a good
plan is to fit the desired strips, cut
from paper, to the box before making
them of the metal. It is well to remember,<span class="pagenum" id="Page289">[289]</span>
in this connection, that the
simple bands and forms are better
suited to the plain box than ornate
trimmings. Having determined upon
suitable patterns for the metal strips,
cut them from the sheet with snips, or
tinner’s shears, care being taken to
produce a smooth edge. A file may be
used to remove roughnesses and to
round the edges of the metal slightly.
The metal is fastened with escutcheon
pins, which add to the ornamental
effect if properly spaced. Holes for
them must be drilled, or punched,
through the metal.</p>

<div class="container w50emmax" id="Fig289">

<p class="caption">The Construction of the Jewelry Box Is Typical of the Others. The Handle is Shown in Detail. The Nailing
of the Bottom and the Fitting of the Lining are Shown at the Right</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The metal may be left smooth and
polished, or hammered with the round
end of a ball-peen hammer, to produce
the dented effect shown on several of
the boxes in the group. This, as well
as other finishing of the metal, must be
done before it is fixed in place. Beautiful
colors may be given to the metal
by heating it, and observing the colors
as they “run.” A trial will enable one
to judge the proper heat for the various
colors, which “run” from a light straw
to a deep purple, with various reddish
intermediate tones. A brown oxidized
finish, or a verd-antique—greenish—finish
may also be obtained. The metal
should be polished with wax to preserve
the finish if other than the latter
type is used.</p>

<p>The boxes are lined with silk or
other suitable material. The method
is as follows: Cut cardboard pieces
to fit against the inner sides of the
bottom, sides, and ends. Pad one side
of them with cotton batting, and cover
with silk, gluing the edges of it on the
back of the cardboard, as shown in the
<a href="#Fig289">sketch</a>. By bending the pieces slightly,
they may be inserted and glued in
place. Care must be taken in handling
the glue, that the silk is not soiled.
Pads of felt, or chamois skin, may be
glued to the bottom of the feet of the
box, so as not to mar the surface upon
which it rests.</p>

<p>The most popular boxes, which are
especially suitable for gift purposes,
are the jewelry, glove, and handkerchief
boxes. Their dimensions are:
jewelry box, 2³⁄₄ by 4 by 7¹⁄₂ in.; glove
box, 3¹⁄₄ by 5 by 13 in.; handkerchief
box, 4 by 6 by 10 in. Other sizes suited
to special purposes may, of course, be
designed readily, and made in walnut,
mahogany, or other cabinet woods.</p>

the upper corners 1 in., at an angle of
45°. Bore holes with a ¹⁄₂-in. bit to
form the rounded ends of the portions
cut out from the lower sides of the
cross braces. Chisel the wood away
between the holes and smooth the resulting
surfaces. The half-lap joint,
by which the cross braces are joined,
may then be made. It should not be
made until the lower portions are cut
out of the cross braces, and the remaining
portions are made of exactly
the same width, 2¹⁄₂ in., according to
the drawing. The joint must be fitted
tightly in what is termed a driving
fit, or it will not be strong enough.</p>

<p>The construction may be assembled
as follows, although several methods
may be adopted that will prove satisfactory:
Fix the cap A to the top of
the post with glue and ¹⁄₂-in. dowels,
bored not quite through the cap.
Screws may be used for this purpose,
but they mar the finish of the upper
surface of the cap. Glue the braces
B into the corners to support the cap.
They should be warmed before applying
the glue and rubbed slightly to
bring them into place tightly and to
distribute the glue evenly. Small
brads may be used to nail them in
place, but care must be taken not to
mar the finish.</p>

<p>The column base D may be fixed to
the bottom of the post in the same way
that the cap was fixed at the upper
end. The cross braces E and F, forming<span class="pagenum" id="Page291">[291]</span>
the base, should be glued in the
half-lap joint and fixed to the column
base with glue and dowels, or screws
sunk into sockets from the lower side
of the braces.</p>

<p>When the glue has dried, the pedestal
should be scraped and cleaned preparatory
to a final sandpapering before
applying the stain and varnish.</p>

<p>The arms G for the shade holder are
made of strips of brass or copper, 1 in.
wide and 8³⁄₄ in. long, bent to the
proper form, as shown in the sketch.
The straight end, 2 in. long, is provided
with two holes through which screws
are fixed into the top of the cap.</p>

<p>The shade is constructed as follows:
Make a 4-in. square, H, of brass strip,
1 in. wide, and solder or rivet it at the
joint. Make the lower square J of the
same material and in the same way,
18 in. on each side. Solder ¹⁄₈-in. wire,
of a length that will give the desired
slant to the shade, at the corners of the
squares, forming a rigid frame for the
covering. Cloth or silk may be used
to cover the frame.</p>

<p>The braces for the shade may then
be fastened to the top of the cap, as
shown in the assembly sketch, and
their ends shaped to hold the frame
firmly. The pedestal should be
smoothed off immediately preparatory
to finishing, and the sharp edges removed
slightly. Care should be taken
in sandpapering, since rubbing across
the grain is ruinous, as is too much
sandpapering. The latter particularly
smacks of the novice. A coat of stain,
one of filler rubbed in thoroughly, a
coat of shellac, and a finish coat of
wax or varnish will give a satisfactory
finish. The shellac and varnish coats
should be permitted to dry thoroughly
and should then be sandpapered lightly
before applying other coats.</p>

<p>The electrical connections for the
lamp may be made from a cord extension
to a socket fixed in the center
of the cap. In some instances it may
be desirable to connect the cord from
a floor socket. In that case the post
should be built up of two pieces of
1-in. thickness, and a groove to admit
the cord made in the center of it.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The detailed construction, for the
making of the desk from stock lumber,
by boys, or amateur workers with tools,
may be carried out as follows: Determine
upon the size of the proposed
desk. Convenient dimensions are 30
in. long, 18 in. wide, 7 in. high at the
back, and 4 in. high at the front. Use
⁷⁄₈-in. soft wood; pine and poplar are
suitable. Cut and shape all the pieces
before beginning the assembling of the
parts. The wood should be planed
smooth and may be sandpapered lightly
when the construction is completed, before
applying a finish. A simple arrangement
of the pieces so they can be
nailed together is that shown in the
sketch, which was used in making the
box. First shape the pieces for the
sides, 5¹⁄₄ in. wide at the larger end,
2¹⁄₄ in. wide at the smaller, and 16¹⁄₄
in. long. Clamp the boards together,
or tack them with two wire nails while
shaping them,
so that they
will be exactly
alike. Make a
piece 5¹⁄₂ in.
wide and 30
in. long for
the back, and
one the same
length and 2¹⁄₂
in. wide for
the front.
Nail them to
the ends, as
shown, permitting
the
slight excess
material
to project
over the upper
edges of the
sidepieces.
Trim off this
extra stock
with a plane
so that the upper surfaces of the front
and back conform to the slant of the
sidepieces. Make a strip 4 in. wide
for the upper edge of the desk, to which
the writing bed is hinged. Cut pieces
for the bottom and nail them in place.</p>

<p>Before nailing down the upper hinge
strip the interior fittings should be
made. Use wood not thicker than ¹⁄₂
in., and fit the pieces into place carefully,
nailing them firmly through the
outer faces of the desk. A better
method is to make the pigeonholes or
compartments with a piece of the thin
stock on the ends of the partitions, so
that the compartments are built up as<span class="pagenum" id="Page293">[293]</span>
a unit and slid into the desk, no nails
being necessary to hold them.</p>

<p>The lid should be made of sound,
dry stock and glued up of strips about
3 in. wide, to prevent it from warping
or twisting easily. If the person making
the desk has the necessary skill, it
is best to fix a strip, 2 in. wide, at each
end of the writing bed, to hold the
pieces together and to keep the bed in
shape.</p>

<p>The holder for the inkwell is made
of a 1-in. strip of metal, bent to the
shape shown in Fig. 4, and drilled to
fit small screws. A can is supported
in the holder and the bottle rests in it.</p>

<p>The desk may be finished by painting
it or giving it a coat of shellac and
one of varnish, either after it has been
stained to match adjoining woodwork,
or in the natural color.</p>

hole in the center. Place a 5-in. flowerpot
over the hole in the metal, and plug
up the hole in the bottom of the pot
with fire clay or plaster of Paris. Vegetables
in jars may be set around the
flowerpot to cook slowly and a roast
in a pan on top of it. A wooden box,
or metal pail, large enough to cover the
arrangement, should be placed over it.
Air holes should be provided in the
lower box and in the cover.</p>

<p>To operate the device light the lamp
and when it is burning brightly, place
it under the table, elevating it so that
the top of the chimney is in the center
and barely within the rim of the flowerpot.
Use little water in the vegetables
and keep the caps loosely on the jars.
The roast, if well buttered, will brown
nicely, and while the cooking will require
considerably more time than it
would in a range, the results will be as
good, if not superior. The natural
juices are preserved by the slow cooking
at comparatively low temperature.

of the proper width—2 in., in this case—and
long enough for the two ends
and the front. Make another strip 1³⁄₄
in. wide and long enough for the partition
and false back of the tray. Cut
these to the lengths indicated in the
detailed sketches of the parts. Mark
out the grooves in the end pieces carefully
and cut them with a saw that
cuts a groove ³⁄₃₂ in. wide. The
grooves may be cut by clamping a
straight strip of wood on the surface
of the ends the proper distance from
the top, and sawing cautiously along
the strip to the proper depth. The
grooves across the grain may be cut
similarly, or in a miter box.</p>

<p>Glue the pieces of the frame together,
taking care that the corners are
square. If necessary, place blocks inside
to insure that the clamping will<span class="pagenum" id="Page297">[297]</span>
not disturb the right angles of the box.
Shape the bottom and cover pieces
nearly to the final size before gluing
them; then, if small nicks are made
in the edge, they may be removed by a
cut of the plane, when the case is complete.
Glue the sliding pieces to the
cover and to the back. This must be
done carefully, and it is convenient to
drive small brads part way into the
second piece, from the inner side, to
prevent the pieces from slipping while
being glued. If proper care is taken,
only a small amount of glue will be
forced out, and this can be removed
with a chisel when dry. The edges
may be trimmed off to their exact size,
and the entire construction given a
final light sandpapering. It is then
ready for the stain and shellac, or other
finish. The parts that slide in grooves
should not be shellacked or varnished,

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">H</span><span class="afterlargecap">omemade</span> toys and gifts, as
well as the “treasure boxes” in
which they are contained, have an
added interest both to the one making
and the one receiving them. The holiday
season makes this work especially
attractive, which affords opportunity
for individuality in construction and
design limited only by the skill of the
worker. The
decorated toys
and the box
described in
detail in this
article are
suggestive
only, and
may be adapted
to a large
variety of
forms and designs.
The
gorgeously
colored <a href="#Fig299b">parrot</a>
and the
gayly caparisoned
<a href="#Fig299b">rider
and horse</a>
suggest a host
of bird and
animal forms, those having possibilities
for attractive coloring being most
desirable. The decorated box shown
in <a href="#Fig302a">Fig. 7</a> may be adapted as a gift box,
to be used where its decoration may
be seen, in the nursery, for example,
and may be made in many forms, in
fact as various as cardboard boxes
are. Plant, animal, or geometrical
forms may be used to work out designs,
and appropriate color schemes
applied to them. A good plan in determining
upon a color scheme is to
use the colors of the flower or other
motif. If the design is not associated
with objects having varied colors—a
geometrical design, for instance—harmonious
colors should be chosen.
These may be bright and contrasting,
as red and green, violet and orange, or
subdued in tone.</p>

<p class="caption long allclear">The Outlines for the Horse and
Rider and the Parrot may be Made
by Enlarging These Sketches. The
Color Scheme Indicated is Suggestive
Only and may be Varied to Suit
Individual Taste</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>A design for a horse and rider,
brightly colored, is shown in <a href="#Fig299b">Fig. 1</a>.
The form is cut out of thin wood, the
color applied,
and the figure
mounted on
the curved
wire, weighted
at one end,
as shown in
<a href="#Fig301b">Fig. 6</a>. The
toy adds a
touch of color
and novelty to
a room, when
suspended
from the corner
of the
mantel, from
a shelf, or
other suitable
place. Balanced
in a
striking attitude,
forefeet upraised, even grown-ups
can hardly resist tipping the rider
to see his mount rear still higher. The
parrot shown in <a href="#Fig299b">Fig. 2</a> is made similarly,
and is weighted at the end of the
tail. The point of balance is at the
feet, which may be fastened to a trapeze,
or be arranged to perch on a convenient
place, like that suited to the
horse and rider.</p>

<p>The tools and equipment necessary
for the making of such toys are simple,
and available in most boys’ workshops
or tool chests. A coping saw, like that
shown at A, <a href="#Fig300">Fig. 3</a>, is suitable for cutting<span class="pagenum" id="Page300">[300]</span>
the wood. A fretsaw, operated by
hand, foot or power, may be used, and
such a tool makes this work quite rapid.
To use the coping saw to the best advantage,
particularly if the work is to
be done on a table which must not be
marred, a sawing board should be
made. In its simplest form, this consists
of a board, as shown at B, about
⁷⁄₈ in. thick, 3¹⁄₂ in. wide, and 6 in. long,
with one end notched. This is clamped
to the end of the table, as at D, with a
clamp, an iron one of the type shown
at C being satisfactory. Another form
of sawing table especially useful when
it is desired to stand up at the work, is
shown at E in detail and clamped in
the vise at F. It consists of a notched
board, 3¹⁄₂ in. wide, fixed at right angles
to a board of similar width, 11 in. long,
and braced at the joint with a block
about 1³⁄₈ in. square. In using the
coping saw with either of these saw
tables, the wood is held down on the
support, as shown in <a href="#Fig301a">Fig. 5</a>, and the saw
drawn downward for each cutting
stroke, thus tending to hold the board
more firmly against the saw table. It
is, of course, important that the saw
be inserted in the coping-saw frame
with the teeth pointing toward the
handle, so that the method of cutting
described may be followed. The wood
must be sawed slowly, especially at the
beginning of a cut. The operator soon
learns the kinks in handling the saw
and wood to the best advantage, and
can then make rapid progress.</p>

The Tools Required are Found in Most Boys’ Workshops, and a Satisfactory Saw Table may
be Made Easily, as Shown in Detail</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>An outline drawing of the form to
be cut out of the wood must first be
made, to the exact size that the object
is to be. There is much satisfaction if
working out the form of the animal or
other figure, especially for the boy or
girl who has the time necessary to do
good work. If desired, the figure may
be traced from a picture obtained from
a book, magazine, or other source. Cut
a piece of wood to the size required
for the design, and place a sheet of
carbon paper over it; or if none is available,
rub a sheet of paper with a soft
pencil, and use this as a carbon paper,
the side covered with the lead being
placed next to the wood. The carbon
paper and the sheet bearing the design
should then be held in place on the
wood with thumb tacks, or pins, and
the transfer made with a pencil, as
shown in <a href="#Fig301a">Fig. 4</a>. The design should
be placed on the wood so that the
weaker parts, such as the legs of the
horse, will extend with the length instead
of across the grain of the wood.<span class="pagenum" id="Page301">[301]</span>
In some instances, where a complicated
form is cut out, it is necessary
to use wood of several plies, and where
this is available it is worth while to
use it for all of this work. For smaller
objects wood ³⁄₁₆ in. thick is suitable,
and stock up to ¹⁄₂ in. in thickness may
be used. Whitewood, basswood, poplar
and other soft, smooth-grained
woods are suitable.</p>

<p class="caption allclear">The Design is Traced Carefully onto the Wood and
Then Cut Out with the Coping Saw, on the Saw Table</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>When the design has been outlined
satisfactorily, place the piece of wood
on the saw table with the design on the
upper side. Holding the wood down
firmly, as shown in <a href="#Fig301a">Fig. 5</a>, and sawing
in the notch of the saw table, cut into
the edge slowly. Apply light pressure
on the downstroke only, as the upstroke
is not intended to cut, and turn
the piece to keep the saw on the line
and in the notch. It is important that
the saw be held vertically so that the
edge of the cut-out portion will be
square. With proper care and a little
practice, the edges may be cut so
smoothly that only a light sandpapering
will be required to produce a
smooth edge. When the figure has
been cut out, smooth the edges by
trimming them carefully with a sharp
knife, if necessary, and sandpaper them
lightly to remove sharp corners. A
fine sandpaper, about No. ¹⁄₂, is suitable
for this purpose. The figure is
then ready for painting. The white is
put on first and the other colors applied
over it, when dry.</p>

<p>Oil paints may be used, and a varnish
or shellac applied over them to
give a high grade of work, but this
process requires much care, considerable
skill, and long drying between
coats to prevent “runs” in the colors.</p>

about three brushfuls of white. A half

<p>The method of making the parrot is
similar to that described for the horse

in <a href="#Fig299b">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that no attempt
is made to secure a lifelike, or realistic,
effect in painting these toy shapes. All
colors are flat, that is, without light
and shade. The toys are really decorative
designs, and the maker is at liberty
to use any colors desired, whether natural
or not.</p>

<p>The horse and rider is balanced on
the hind foot, as shown in <a href="#Fig301b">Fig. 6</a>, by

wire, as a counterweight. The wire
should be set into the body of the
horse, behind the foreleg, to a depth of
³⁄₄ in. The weight of the metal and
the curve of the wire should be adjusted
to obtain the proper balance.
The parrot is balanced in the
same way, except that the
weight is fixed to the end of
the tail, which is curved like
the wire.</p>

<p>These and other homemade
toys or gifts may be sent or
contained appropriately in
boxes decorated to match them,
as shown in <a href="#Fig302a">Fig. 7</a>. They may
be made complete, or commercial
boxes of suitable sizes may
be covered and decorated. If
good materials are used, such
a box makes a pretty and useful
gift in itself. The complete
process of making a typical
box is described for those who
prefer to make one of special
size. The dimensions given are
thus only suggestive, and may

The Various Steps in the Process of Making and Covering a Rectangular Cardboard Box are Shown in Detail.
The Method of Making a Pattern for the Design is shown Below</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The box is made as follows: Determine
upon the proper size and select
materials to carry out the design. An
appropriate combination of colors and
materials is suggested in <a href="#Fig302b">Fig. 8</a>. Cut
out a square of the cardboard, having
sides 12¹⁄₂ in. long, as shown in <a href="#Fig303">Fig. 9</a>,
at G, then mark it as indicated and cut
on the full line to remove the square
corners. Crease it on the dotted lines
and fold to form a box. To hold the
cardboard in box shape, strips of bond
paper—ordinary writing paper—are
cut, 3³⁄₄ in. long and 1 in. wide, then
creased along their centers and pasted
to the corners. The paste should be
applied to the paper strip first, then on
the corners of the box. Apply the piece
of paper over the corner of the box on
the outside, pressing it to make a snug
fit. Repeat this operation on the other
corners.</p>

<p>Lay off the dimensions given at H
on the selected color of cover paper,
which in this instance is plum, and
score the lines indicated. Spread paste
smoothly over the surface of the plum
paper, between the lines drawn ³⁄₈ in.
from the long edges, and then spread a
thin layer of paste over the outer surface
of one of the sides of the box.
Apply the paper to the pasted surface
and press it down, rubbing gently out
from the center to remove air bubbles.
Fold the ³⁄₈-in. laps at the top and bottom
over the upper edge of the box and
around the lower corner. Repeat this
process, covering the four sides. To
form a smooth fold at the corners, it
is best to miter the paper as shown at
J and K, before pasting it down. Then
paste a square of the same paper 4⁷⁄₈
in. wide on the bottom of the box, taking
care to match the edges evenly all
around.</p>

<p>Line the box with a strip of lining
paper, 20 in. long and 4 in. wide. Try
the lining by folding it into the box so
that its upper edge is about ¹⁄₈ in. from
the edge of the box, and crease it carefully
into the corners. Remove it, apply
paste, and press it well into the
corners when pasting it down. Paste
a square of the same paper, 4⁷⁄₈ in
wide, in the bottom of the box.</p>

<p>The cover is made by the same process
as the main portion of the box. The
dimensions of the cardboard are shown
at L, and the covering at M. It should
be observed that the cover is slightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page304">[304]</span>
wider than the box, so that it will fit
easily.</p>

<p>When the box is thoroughly dry, it
is ready to receive the decorations on
the top and sides. The design may be
adapted from a leaf, flower, or similar
form, as well as from geometric or animal
forms. The horse and rider, the
parrot, and the animals shown in the
headpiece of this article are all suggestive
of animal forms that are available.</p>

<p>The design shown on the box in <a href="#Fig302a">Fig.
7</a> was adapted from a flower form, two
of the units being joined for the decoration
on the top. To obtain a pattern
for the design, fold a piece of paper,
2 by 4 in., as shown at N, and outline
one-half of a leaf, flower or similar motif.
Cut the folded paper as at O, and
a pattern similar to that shown at P
results. Trace around this to place the
figure on the box. Outline the figure
with black, about ¹⁄₈ in. wide, as at Q.
The oval figures, suggestive of small
pods on a flower, are also outlined in
black, and joined to the main portion
of the design by a black line. Thinner
black lines are drawn vertically across
the form, and small circles placed along
them at intervals. The color scheme
is shown in <a href="#Fig302b">Fig. 8</a>. The light background
is yellow, the small circles are
emerald-green, and the ovals red-orange.
The rim of the cover is decorated
with a border of white ovals, outlined
in black. The corners are banded
in black and white as shown in <a href="#Fig302a">Fig. 7</a>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Care and Storage of Camp Equipment</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>A slovenly sportsman misses much
of the joy of the man who takes pride
in giving his outfit the proper care, not
only during its period of use, but also
during the winter, when occasional
overhauling serves to keep one in touch
with sports of other seasons. And a
very real joy it is, each article recalling
an experience as one examines it minutely
for a possible rust spot, scratch,
or injury.</p>

<p>Tents usually come in for much
abuse, which shortens their life considerably.
Cotton duck molds quickly,
and rots if left rolled up damp. Care
should be taken, therefore, to insure
its perfect dryness before storing. Silk
and silk-composition tents, being
thoroughly waterproof, are almost as
dry after a rain or dew as before, so
may be packed for moving at any time.
But all tents and tarpaulins should be
washed and dried carefully after the
season’s use.</p>

<p>Blankets absorb much moisture, and
should be shaken and spread out over
bushes to dry in the sun, at least once
a week. In the cold nights of late
summer, the increased warmth of
blankets after drying is considerable.</p>

<p>Pack straps and ropes should not
be left exposed to the weather. They
speedily become hard or brittle; squirrels
like the salt they can obtain by
chewing the leather, and if left on
the ground in a rabbit country, the
straps are soon cut into bits. Hang the
leather goods in the peak of the tent,
keep them away from fire, and oil them
occasionally.</p>

<p>A canoe should not be left in the
water overnight, or at any time when
it is not in use. Simply because use
makes it wet, a canoe should not be
left so any more than a gun should be
left dirty, or an ax dull. If on a cruise
with a heavy load, pile the stuff on
shore at the night camp, and turn the
canoe over it. If a canoe is permitted
to remain in the water unnecessarily,
or its inside exposed to rain, it soon becomes
water-soaked and heavy for
portage, besides drying out when exposed
to the sun, and developing leaks.</p>

<p>Small punctures in the bottom of a
canoe may be mended with spruce,
tamarack, or pine gum, melted into
place with a glowing firebrand, held
close, while blowing at the spot to be
repaired. Torn rags of canvas-covered
bottoms may be glued with the softer
gum of new “blazes,” gathered with a
knife or flat stick.</p>

<p>While traveling on shallow streams
the bottom of a board canoe develops a
“fur” of rubbed-up shreds. Every<span class="pagenum" id="Page305">[305]</span>
night these should be cut short with
a sharp-pointed knife, to prevent a
shred from pulling out and developing
into a large splinter. The paddles,
and the setting pole, unless shod with
iron, become burred at the ends and
require trimming down to solid wood.</p>

<p>The track line, if in use, is wet most
of the time, and unless dried frequently,
becomes rotten. Every tracker
knows the grave danger with a rotten
line in a rapids.</p>

<p>During the winter the canoe should
be scraped and sandpapered, bulges
nailed down, permanent repairs made
to the covering, and the canoe painted
on the exterior and varnished on the
interior.</p>

<p>The average fisherman is an enthusiast
who needs no urging in the
matter of caring for his outfit, and the
user of firearms should profit by this
example. Even if not a shot has been
fired from a gun all day, moisture from
the hands, or from the dampness in
the woods, or marshes, may cause rust
spots, or corrode the bore. Rub an oily
rag through the bore and over the outside
of the gun every evening, before
laying it aside.</p>

<p>Cleaning rods are safer and more
thorough in cleaning the bore than
the common mouse string, which may
break when drawing a heavy piece of
cloth through, causing much difficulty.
A wooden rod, preferably of hickory,
is best, although the metal rod is
stronger for use in small bores, but
care must be taken not to wear the
muzzle unduly. The hunting weapons
should be carefully overhauled before
storing them, and given a coat of oil
to protect the metal parts from rust.—A.

long, open at the ends. It is 3¹⁄₂ in.
wide and made of wood, ³⁄₈ in. thick.
A mirror is fitted at an angle of 45° near
one end of the box or tube, as shown in
the sketch. The front of the mirror is
opposite a three-cornered opening in
the box which extends across one side.
The opposite end of the tube is also
fitted with a mirror in the same manner,
except that the front of the mirror
faces to the opposite side of the box
at which there is also an opening.
In using this device, the user
sights from the point indicated by the
eye. The image is reflected in the
mirror at the top and thrown onto
the lower mirror, where it may be seen
without exposing the head above the
level of the lower opening. It is this
application of reflection by mirrors that
makes it possible for soldiers to see distant
objects without exposing themselves
to fire, by the use of the periscope.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A Colonial Mirror Frame</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Black walnut, or mahogany, is the
most effective wood to use in making
this simple but artistic frame. It requires
a very small amount of stock
and what is used should be of a good
quality and carefully worked to the
given dimensions with keen tools. The
stock required for the frame is as
follows:</p>

<table class="stufflist mirror">

<tr>
<td colspan="2" class="center">Black walnut, or mahogany:</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td class="nr">1</td>
<td class="text">piece, 25 in. long, 9 in. wide, and ¹⁄₈ in.
thick.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>The dimensions for the walnut or
mahogany pieces are rough sizes, oversize
to allow for the planing to the dimensions
given in the sketch. The
white holly may be procured smoothly
planed on both sides and of the exact
thickness required. The picture backing
may be purchased in almost any
store that sells frames. It is usually
rough pine and inexpensive.</p>

<p>The first operation is to plane the
frame pieces on one side and edge,
using great care to insure both being
perfectly straight and the edge square
with the face. Gauge for, and plane to
the thickness required, although this
need not be exactly ⁵⁄₈ in. as called for,
but if the stock will stand ¹¹⁄₁₆ in. or ³⁄₄
in. do not take the time to cut it down
to ⁵⁄₈ in. The little cross rail must be
exactly ¹⁄₈ in. thick, as it is to be let
¹⁄₈ in. into the rabbet cut for the glass,
which makes it come ¹⁄₈ in. back from
the face of the frame when it is in
place. Plane all of these pieces to the
width, 1¹⁄₈ inch.</p>

<p>For cutting the rabbet, a plow, or a
³⁄₄-in. grooving, plane is the best tool
to use, but if neither is available a rabbet
plane can be used. Be sure to
plane the rabbet square and to the
lines gauged for the depth and width.</p>

<p>To groove the pieces for the holly
strips a special tool is required. This
may be made of a piece of soft sheet<span class="pagenum" id="Page307">[307]</span>
steel or iron, which must be of a thickness
to correspond to that of the holly.
A piece 2¹⁄₂ in. long, and of almost any
width, will answer the purpose. File
one edge of the metal straight, and cut
saw teeth in it by filing straight across
with a small saw file. Remove the burr
raised by the filing by rubbing each
side on an oilstone. Drill two holes
in it for fastening with screws to a
piece of hard wood. The wood serves
as a fence, and if properly fastened to
the metal, the teeth should cut a groove
¹⁄₁₆ in. deep and ³⁄₁₆ in. from the edge.
The holly strip should fit the groove
tightly so that it can be driven home
with light taps of a hammer. It is
well to try the tool on a bit of waste
wood first to see if it cuts the groove
properly.</p>

<p>The holly is cut into strips, ¹⁄₈ in.
wide with a slitting gauge. An ordinary
marking gauge, with the spur
filed flat on each side to make a sharp,
deep line, will do very well for this
work. The gauging is done from both
sides of the piece to make the spur cut
halfway through from each side. Before
the slitting is attempted, one edge
of the piece is first straightened. This
is readily accomplished with a fore
plane, laid on its side and used as a
shoot plane. The strip to be planed is
laid flat on a piece of ⁷⁄₈-in. stock with
one edge projecting slightly. This
raises it above the bench and allows
the fore plane to be worked against the
projecting edge.</p>

<p>The strips should be applied to the
groove to test the fit, and if found to
be tight, they must be tapered slightly
by filing or scraping the sides. If the
fit is good, hot glue may be run into
the grooves with a sharp stick, and the
strips driven into place. They will
project above the surface slightly,
but no attempt should be made to
plane them off flush until the glue has
become thoroughly hardened; then use
a sharp plane, and finish with a scraper
and No. 00 sandpaper.</p>

<p>The miters are cut in a miter box,
or planed to the exact 45° angle on a
miter shoot board. Before gluing the
corners, the recesses are cut for the
cross rail, but it must not be put in
place until the corners of the frame
have been fastened and the glue given
time to dry.</p>

<p class="caption">An Inlay of Holly Makes an Exceedingly Pretty
Frame of Colonial Design for a Mirror</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The frame may be given either a
dull or bright finish. The dull finish
gives a rich appearance and is very
easy to apply. Give the completed
frame one coat of white shellac, and
when it is dry, rub the surface with
very fine sandpaper until it has a
smooth finish. Finish with any of the
prepared waxes, being careful to follow
the directions furnished.</p>

<p>Before putting the board back of the
mirror, be sure to place two or three
sheets of clean paper on the silvered
surface. The picture board is fastened
with glazier’s points, or with
small bung-head wire nails. The back
is finished by gluing a sheet of heavy
wrapping paper to the edges of the
frame. If the wrapping paper is moistened
with a damp cloth before it is
applied, it will dry out smooth and
tightly drawn over the back.</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">A</span> <span class="afterlargecap">comfortable</span> and novel
after-dinner chair for the man in
the household can be made by fitting a
morris chair, or other
armchair, with devices
which appeal especially
to a man. The chair
shown is that of the
ordinary mission morris
type. It is of simple
outline and can be
made by the home mechanic
of fair skill in
furniture making. The
details of its construction,
while not essential
to a description of
the special fittings, are
shown in the several
working drawings. The
joints used for the
framework are of the
common mortise-and-tenon
variety. The
back is a plain frame,
fitted with vertical
slats, and hinged to a
shoulder in the back
legs, as shown in the
side view. For a substantial
piece of furniture,
oak or other
hard wood should be used; as a piece
of porch or summer-cottage furniture,
the chair may be made of softer woods.
The cushion can be made of various
leathers, or upholstery fabrics. It is
built over a wooden frame and is
removable. The seat bottom may be
paneled, and a loose cushion fitted into
it, and a similar one bound with thongs
to the back of the chair.</p>

<p>The drawer is slightly different from
the standard construction in that the
front is arranged as a blind rail. It
fits snugly between the front legs and
is suspended from strips fitted between
the pairs of legs at the sides.</p>

<p>No handle is provided, as the drawer
can be opened easily by grasping it
underneath the front board. Pipes,
smoker’s supplies, or a variety of other
articles may be stored handily in it.</p>

The screen was cut down to form a

screen were used for the frames of the
doors on the front, and for the top. The
panels were made from a good
quality of three-ply stock, with
a hardwood face, which was
scraped, sandpapered, and
brought to a very smooth finish.
The material happened to
have a pretty grain, and this
added to the effect when it was
stained and varnished. Pieces
of this stock were used for the

fittings, such as the
shelves for records and the
drawer below the horn. Space

<p class="blankbefore75">The two ends, A, are marked to the
same outline and cut with a coping or
scroll saw. If a fine-toothed saw is
used, the edges of the boards can be
easily smoothed with sandpaper, otherwise
a file is necessary to remove the
coarse saw traces. The rails B are cut
to size and squared up at the ends, after
which they can be placed at the proper
places on the ends A, which may then
be marked for the notches to receive
the rails. In fastening the rails to the
end pieces, 2-in. round-head screws can
be used. The seat C is attached to the
back rail by 2-in. butt hinges. To prevent
the seat from sagging in the middle,
it is supported on each side by
cleats screwed to the end pieces A. If
the seat is liable to warp it can be held
straight by two cleats screwed underneath.
The bottom board D may be
held in place by means of screws
through the rails, or by resting on
cleats screwed to the end pieces. The

<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> N. E. STUDEBAKER</span></h2>

</div><!--container-->

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">T</span><span class="afterlargecap">he</span> floor space in our high-school
shop is somewhat limited, leaving
no room on the floor for the gluing
press, and during a large part of the
year the temperature on the floor is too
low for gluing. We met these conditions
with the gluing press illustrated.</p>

<p>Three pairs, or sets, of steps, A, were
made of pine, 2 in. thick, and fastened
in a series by strips B, so that they all
would move forward or backward between
the guides C, which are nailed
to the floor above the shop. On one
of the steps—the corresponding one in
each pair—rests a piece of wood, D,
4 in. wide and 2 in. thick, through
which, near its ends, are bored holes
to receive lengths of 1-in. gas pipe, E.
Over these holes and screwed to the
wood piece are 1-in. floor flanges, F.
The pipes E are threaded at one end
so that they will screw through the
floor flanges about 3 in. On the other
ends of the gas pipes are fitted pieces
of material, 4 in. wide and 2 in. thick,
G, resting on washers, which in turn
rest on the locknuts H. The locknuts
H prevent the tees J from unscrewing
in operating the press. A rod is used
through the tees as a handle for screwing
the pipes E on or out of the floor
flanges F. On top of the pieces G rests
the floor K, on which are placed the
pieces to be glued. On the under side
of the ceiling joists, and directly over
the floor K, is spiked the 2-in. piece L,
between which piece and the floor K
the material is pressed. For the sake
of stiffness and lightness the floor K is
built up of 1-in. material, as shown in
the detail. This floor may be raised or
lowered by the windlass M. The windlass
is simply a ³⁄₄-in. gas pipe turning
in bearings fastened to the under side
of the ceiling joists.</p>

<p class="caption">The Gluing Press is Attached to the Ceiling Where It Is Out of the Way and Where the Temperature Is
More Correct for Making a Strong-Holding Joint</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Supposing the press to be standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page314">[314]</span>
as shown in the drawings, it is operated
as follows: The pipes E are unscrewed
so that their upper ends are
flush with the top surface of the floor
flanges F. The ropes N are wound up
a trifle on the windlass M, thus raising
the pieces D, the pipes E, and the
floor K. Lifting D clear of the steps
releases the latter so that the entire
series may be moved to the right by
pulling the rope O. In unwinding the
ropes from the windlass, D is let down
on the lowest step, which has just been
drawn directly under it. This operation
lowers the floor K to its lowest
limit and the pieces to be glued are
placed, one on the other, on this floor.
If the total thickness of the material
to be glued is sufficient to nearly fill
the space between the floor and the
piece L, a rod is thrust through J, and
the pipes are screwed up, thus pressing
the material between the floor K
and the piece L. If, however, the material
does not fill the space well, then
the ropes N are wound up on the windlass
M, thus raising the floor and its
contents as far as possible, and by pulling
the rope P the steps are drawn as
far to the left as possible and D rests
on a higher step, thus lessening the
space to be taken up by the screws.
The pipes are then screwed up tightly
as in the first operation. Our press is
operated from a mezzanine floor where
all the gluing is done.</p>

<p>An inexpensive, yet very efficient, die
for cutting quantities of tin foil, sheet
lead, paper, and cardboard can be made
from a steel rule such as used by
printers. Procure a rule, two points or
about ¹⁄₃₂ in. thick, which comes in 2-ft.
lengths. The rule can be readily bent
without annealing. Bend it to the desired
shape and solder, or weld, the ends
together. To give it rigidity, fill in the
space with melted lead to a depth of
half the height of the die.</p>

<p>Place the material to be cut against
the die and put both into a vise, or letter
press. Apply pressure steadily until
the die has cut through the last
thickness of the material. As many as
5 pieces can be placed and cut at one
time. When cutting designs for static
machines, etc., from tin foil, this appliance
does away with the tedious work
of cutting one at a time, and then, too,
they will all be uniform. In making the
connection at the ends of the rule, be
sure that they meet evenly and do not
lap to make the joint.—Contributed by

<p>As the main sides are of considerable
width, it would be best to make them of
two pieces glued together and, in order
to obtain a strong and neat joint, to
have this done by an experienced joiner,
or in the mill. The back edges should
be carefully planed, and rabbeted ³⁄₈ in.
deep by ¹⁄₂ in. wide for the ³⁄₈-in. thick
back. The bottom or foot piece of the
sides should be squared up with the
back edges, or the completed desk is
liable to be winding, or warped. The
bottom and top shelves or main cross
braces should be marked and cut out,
and, to be in harmony with the shape of
the sides, the lower-shelf tenons are
made wider than those on the upper
shelf. The top shelf should be rabbeted
¹⁄₂ in. deep by ³⁄₈ in. wide, to fit the
back boards which are nailed to it. The
required mortises in the sidepieces are
marked from the corresponding tenons
of the shelves, and can then be cut out
with a chisel. When finished, the four
parts constituting the frame should be
assembled, and may be held together
with blind screws, or dowel pins, passed
through the tenons.</p>

<p>The desk board and two library
shelves should then be fitted, and fastened
in place with blind screws
through the sides, or with cleats from
the inside. For a neat, finished appearance,
the back boards should be carefully
joined, exposing no cracks, and
fastened with nails driven into the various<span class="pagenum" id="Page317">[317]</span>
shelves. The upper rail, resting on
the bookcase, and the lower rail, forming
part of the drawer support, can then
be fitted and secured to the sides with
blind screws, either from the outside
or diagonally through the rails from the
inside. Drawer slides are fitted in place
flush with the top edge of the lower rail,
and fastened to the sides with screws.</p>

<p>In making the drawer, the usual
construction should be followed. The
front piece should be rabbeted near its
lower edge to fit the drawer bottom,
and notched ¹⁄₂ in. at each end to fit the
sides. The bottom and end pieces fit
into grooves cut in the sides. Suitable
drawer pulls or knobs should be provided.</p>

<p>For the doors of the bookcase, the
best construction would be to tenon the
rails into the stiles about ¹⁄₂ in. The
glass panel fits in a notch, ¹⁄₂ in. deep
and ¹⁄₄ in. wide, cut around the inside
ledge of the door, and is held in position
with molding strips. In order to give
the door an appearance of being divided
into four parts, mullions, or cross
strips, are fitted on the outer side of the
glass flush with the rails and stiles, and
fastened to them with brads. The
doors are attached with butt hinges.</p>

<p>In making the desk door, a specially
selected board should be used, as the
finished appearance of the desk will
greatly depend on this. The ends and
sides should be perfectly squared, and
the lower or hinge end cut beveled corresponding
to the edge of the desk
board. Butt hinges are used to secure
it in position, and hinged brackets or
chains provided to support it when
open. When closed, it rests against a
strip fastened to the lower side of the
bottom bookcase shelf.</p>

<p>In arranging the pigeonholes it is
best to have the inside boards rest on
the desk board, so that, when desired,
the entire arrangement of the drawers
and shelves may be withdrawn easily.
When thoroughly sandpapered and
finished to taste, a serviceable, handy
and attractive piece of furniture is obtained,
suitable for either office or
home.—Contributed by James Gaffney,

<p>Having considerable trouble with a

blower covers the upper part of the fireplace
and forces the draft through the
basket grate until the fire gets a good
start, then it can be removed. Before
making the blower I again had trouble
one morning when the chimney would
not draw, and the whole room became
filled with smoke; I then grabbed a
newspaper and held it up against the
upper part of the fireplace like a regular
blower. To my surprise the suction
of the chimney held the newspaper in
place without any outside aid. In a few
minutes the fire was roaring, and best of
all, when it became hot, the newspaper
caught fire and was sucked into the
flames. This in reality became an automatic
blower, as it removed itself when
no longer needed.—Contributed by

slides, are fixed to the lower rail of the

provided with rabbeted edges, as indicated
by the width G, and the height
H, in which frames of light weight,
for the 5 by 7-in. glass plates, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page321">[321]</span>
fitted. The frames may be made, or
plain, cheap picture frames may be
used. The sliding frame is raised and
lowered by means of the handle F.
The cardboard covering the larger
frame should be painted a dull black,
and the wooden parts may be shellacked
in the natural color.</p>

<p>When developing films or plates, the
frames with the red and yellow glasses
should be inserted in the sliding
frame, and held in place by turn buttons.
The red glass will ordinarily be
satisfactory for developing, but on
very bright days, with the sun shining
directly on the glass, a layer or two of
“post-office” paper is placed over it.
The yellow glass may be used when
fixing, and other work requiring a subdued
light, but not when developing is
done. For printing, put in the yellow
and the ground glasses, the latter admitting
sufficient light for the purpose.
To use the dark room occasionally in
the evening, I set a lamp on a well-protected
shelf outside of the opening
in the cardboard, and proceed as in the
use of daylight.</p>

are mounted on the front of the clock,
as shown in the illustration. The ring
on arm A should be slipped under both
hands, and should have spring enough
to hold it in contact with the small
clock hand. The ring fixed to arm B
must be in contact with the large hand,
but must be some distance from the
small hand and the smaller ring, so
that they will not come into contact
when the hands cross each other. An
offset in the arm A, and a piece of mica
insulation, are provided where the
larger ring crosses the bar A. On the
surface of each ring, between it and its
respective hand, is glued a piece of
white paper, cut to conform with the
ring, but ¹⁄₁₆ in. larger, so as to extend
over the outer edge of the brass rings.
The rings of paper are saturated in a
solution of potassium chloride and permitted
to dry, before being placed on
the brass rings.</p>

<p>A high-tension current, passing
through the coil D, enters the arm A,
passes to the small hand, to the large
hand, and out at the terminal on arm
B. Black dots will appear on the prepared

it was opened. The arms A and B
must be well insulated from one another.
For greater accuracy in recording
time, to within ¹⁄₂ minute, prepared
paper dials, with hour and minute
marks, coming into contact with the
hands at small projections punched in
the hands from their upper surfaces,
should be used. An ordinary secondary
coil from an automobile may
be used, and if the clock has a wooden

<p>Not infrequently home or shop mechanics
find that trifling odd jobs are
neglected repeatedly, simply because
they are not of sufficient consequence
to warrant getting out the tools or
materials necessary for the work. A
convenient method of insuring that
these small jobs are not overlooked is
to make a memorandum of them and
place it with the tools required for the
work. For instance, if a small job of
soldering is to be done, a memorandum
placed with the soldering outfit will
not easily be overlooked, and the work
may be done while the coppers are hot
for use in a larger job. Likewise with
small painting jobs. Sometimes only
a brushful of paint is needed and one
does not care to mix a small quantity<span class="pagenum" id="Page323">[323]</span>

<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> LAWRENCE F. CAMPBELL</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">O</span><span class="afterlargecap">ne</span> of the chief difficulties in developing
plates in a nonreversible
developing tank is that irregular development
takes place, because the
developer tends to settle more or less,
depending on the time necessary for
complete development. The construction
of a reversible tank is a simple
matter, and the cost is slight. The tank
described is 3¹⁄₄ by 4¹⁄₄, in. in size, but
the dimensions can be varied for other
sizes of plates. The tank is a box
having grooves in opposite ends for
the plates. By placing the latter back
to back, 12 can be developed at a time.
Sheet rubber is fitted between the
cover and the body of the tank, and
the cover, upon being screwed down,
makes a water-tight compartment of
the box. The asphaltum paint used is
not affected by the developer, and preserves
the wood. Fixing and developing
may both be done in the one tank,
but it is preferable to use the tank for
developing only.</p>

snake on the birch surface, and cut it
out very carefully on the band saw, or
with a fine hand turning saw. The
snake portion will drop out and is then
separated into a walnut and a birch
strip, making two similar snakes. Bore
holes for the eyes and plug them with
the opposite kind of wood. Replace the
snakes in opposite positions, the one of
birch in the walnut side, and the walnut
one in the birch side. Glue them carefully

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">M</span><span class="afterlargecap">any</span> amateur photographers have
occasion to make a considerable
number of prints and find the washing
of them tedious, by the
ordinary methods. In
order to overcome this
difficulty the print-washing
machine
shown in the sketch
was made. It is simple
in construction and
performs the work
quite satisfactorily at a
saving of not a little
time. Since the water
in which the prints
are washed must be agitated,
a pivoted tray is
provided. A unique
feature is the water
wheel through which
the water supply
passes, at the same
time developing power
to operate the rocker
arm, by means of which
the tray is agitated.</p>

<p>The frame for the large trough,
which contains the tray and other apparatus,
is made of 2 by 4-in. uprights,
braced with 2 by 2-in. pieces.
The trough is made of ⁷⁄₈-in. stock,
joined at the ends with a water-tight
grooved, or dado, joint. The top is
fitted to form a cover and may be
hinged or arranged as a lid, supported
and held in place by cleats, fixed on
its under side with screws. The
trough and its fittings may be made of
a size suited to individual requirements.
The device illustrated is 4 ft.
long, and has a trough 18 in. wide and
13 in. high. The interior of the trough
is given a coat of tar to make it waterproof,
and the exterior may be painted
thoroughly to preserve the wood.</p>

<p>The rocking tray, in which the prints
are placed, is made of ⁵⁄₈-in. stock. It
is 5 in. high, 15 in. wide, and 28 in.
long. Splash boards are fixed at its
ends, as shown, and the bottom is made
of muslin, reinforced with wooden
strips, ¹⁄₂ in. wide. The tray is supported
on a rod or pipe at its center,
the ends of the support being set into
the sides of the trough. A crank arm
of wood or metal is attached to the
center of one end of the tray, and operates
through an opening in the top
of the trough. The crank arm engages
a crank fixed to the shaft of the water
wheel, as shown in the sketch. The
crank must be made not longer than
2 in., or the resulting action on the tray
will pour out too much water, the
prints being thus in danger of damage.</p>

<p>The water wheel is made of two
round disks of sheet metal, 9 in. in
diameter. Strips of wood are fitted
between them so that the wheel is
3 in. wide on the face. Wooden blocks,
grooved to fit the shaft of the water
wheel, are used as bearings. They are
fixed to the top with bolts. The water
supply is provided through a pipe at
one end. A cap is fitted over the end
of the extension on the pipe and a small
hole drilled through it. This forces the
water against the blades of the water
wheel rather than permitting it to drop
under normal pressure. The flow of
water is regulated by the valve on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page328">[328]</span>
supply pipe, and the excess water is
drained off at the opposite end of the
trough. The force of the water, as it
leaves the water wheel, is lessened, and
the water carried gently to the tray, by
means of a board set between the top
and the tray, at the wheel end of the
trough.</p>

<p>Sectional poultry fencing has several
advantages over stationary fencing:
It can be easily moved, the poultry
yard being made larger, smaller,

a crop and gradually included in the
yard, furnishing greens for the poultry.
Also, the tenant who does not
care to put down permanent equipment,
will find sectional fencing desirable.</p>

a part of their equipment may
be interested in a portable skylight,
which I made and use with thorough

Covered with imitation leather, it is
quite presentable in carrying it about.
Figure 9 shows the case closed, with
stand, flash lamp, box of flash powder,
and a white-cloth reflector inside. The
apparatus set up for work is shown in
Fig. 5, and the details of construction
in the other sketches.</p>

pieces, C, and tack one to one side of
each of the frames. Cut a similar
piece, E, 15 by 26¹⁄₂ in., and hinge it
with strong cloth, or thin leather, to
the inner side of the thicker frame, to
form the roof E, Fig. 5. Hinge the
two frames with three butt hinges.</p>

<p>The frame is then ready for covering,
and for this purpose imitation
leather is economical and practical.
Two yards of 36-in. material is needed.
Use hot glue, first on the bottom half
of the case, applying it smoothly, and
press the fabric into place. Then
cover the sides, the upper half, and the
roof. The covering must be in one
piece to prevent the smoke from escaping
at the joints. Glue down the edges
inside of the case, and set it aside for
24 hours to dry.</p>

<p>While waiting for the case to dry,
the work on the bag can be done. Two
yards of close-woven white muslin, or
one yard of 60-in. sheeting, is required
for the front. For the sides, closely
woven black material should be used.
Figures 1 and 2 show the dimensions,
the white portions representing patterns,
and the shaded portions material<span class="pagenum" id="Page331">[331]</span>
for hems and seams. The material
is folded over the pattern, basted
down, and hemmed at the dotted lines,
1¹⁄₂ in. from the edge. Sew the front
to the curved sides. Allowance for
shrinkage, when the bag is washed and
fireproofed, has been made in these
sizes.</p>

<p>For fireproofing the bag, the following
formula is good: water, 60 oz., ammonium
phosphate, 4 oz., ammonium
chloride, 8 oz. Soak the fabric half an
hour, wring it out slightly, and hang
it up to dry.</p>

<p>Cut a hole, 6 in. square, in the lower
half of the case for the door F, Fig. 5.
The door is of galvanized sheet iron,
7 in. square, covered on one side with
imitation leather and provided with a
leather handle. The door slides in
guides of mount board, or metal, as
shown in Fig. 4. Figure 8 shows the
notch below the door to allow play for
the spring of the flash lamp, in place
in Figs. 5 and 6. Mine was made for
cartridges, but by attaching a pan of
heavy tin, I use it for flash powder.</p>

<p>The leather socket, into which the
top of the holder G, is slipped, is shown
in detail in Fig. 7. Suitcase catches,
D, lock the apparatus in open or closed
position. The roof E, is supported by
two folding desk slides.</p>

<p>To fasten the bag in place, slip a
cheap yardstick, or strip, cut to the
proper length, in each of the hems at
the edges, and set them snugly inside
and against the sides of the open case
and under the edge of the roof. Fasten
them with screws, as shown at the
edges in Fig. 5. The bag is easily removed
by withdrawing the screws and
the strips, for washing and fireproofing
it again. The front must hang
away from the lamp before the charge
is fired, or the bag may be burned.
After firing the flash, the skylight is
carried out and the smoke expelled.</p>

papers, to be used in localities
not equipped with gas or electricity
and where printing is to be done after

measurements given are only approximate,
as conditions will determine its
size. That shown is made as follows:
First procure a 6¹⁄₂ by 8¹⁄₂-in. or 8 by
10-in. printing frame. Remove the
brass clips from the pad and fasten one
end of the pad to the frame, by a pair
of small hinges, with the glass in the
frame. Procure a box, about 12 by 15
in., by 8 in. deep,
with one side
open. Cut a rectangular
opening
through the 12 by
15-in. side a
bit smaller than the
printing frame,
and secure the
frame in place
over the opening
with screws. Saw
a slot ³⁄₄ in. wide
through the top of
the box—the end
nearest the hinged
end of the printing
frame pad—running
it the full
width and about
3 in. from the
front.</p>

<div class="container w35emmax">

<img src="images/illo337.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">Photographic Printing may be Done Rapidly by the

</div><!--container-->

<p>Nail cleats along
the inside of each side of the box, placing
them vertical and parallel, and about
³⁄₄ in. apart, so as to form a slide groove
in conjunction with the slot. This
groove is to receive a frame or curtain
constructed of stock, 2 in. wide and
¹⁄₂ in. thick. The outside dimensions
of the curtain are a trifle smaller than
the inside measurements of the box
itself. Cover the frame with orange
paper, and when finished insert it
through the slot in the top of the box.
Build a frame as indicated, on the outside
of the box. Along the inside of
the uprights fasten cleats, thick enough
to come flush with the ends of the slot.
These serve to steady the curtain when
raised. Make a suitable baseboard and
secure the box to it. Then with sheet
tin construct a lamp house extending
from the back of the box and of sufficient
size to accommodate a round-wick
lamp. Leave an opening in the top
to admit the chimney, provide holes
for ventilation, and a door by which
the lamp may be adjusted. When
completed, paint the interior of the
box and lamp house white, to intensify
the printing quality
of the light.
Tie a piece of
stout cord to a
screw eye inserted
in the upper end
of the sliding curtain,
lead it
through two pulleys
fastened as
shown, and down
to the hand lever.
The latter is
pivoted at the
rear end by a bolt.
Attach a spring to
the lower end of
the hinged pad on
the printing
frame. This holds
the pad out of the
way when not in
use. A curtain-roller
spring is suitable for this purpose.</p>

<p>To operate the machine, place the
negative and paper in position, and,
with the left hand, bring the pad down.
Pull down the hand lever with the
right hand, raising the orange curtain.
When the required exposure is made,
release the lever, shutting off the direct
light. While nearly all light is shut
out by means of the lamp house, the
paper may be handled safely and easily
by means of that admitted through the
orange curtain. By systematic arrangement<span class="pagenum" id="Page334">[334]</span>
and handling of materials,
it is surprising what an amount of
work can be turned out by the aid of
this machine, especially if one person
attends to the exposing and another to
the developing.</p>

condenser with the gradual capacity
variation of a variable one. It is suitable
for a wireless receiving circuit, or
to shunt around the vibrator of an induction
coil, by making the units considerably

fixed condensers, connected in
parallel, a lever being the means
whereby the capacity is varied. Five
or more units may be used, each being
a small condenser, built up of 10 sheets
of waxed paper and nine sheets of tin
foil. A convenient size for the tin foil
is 6 by 4 in., and for the paper, 5¹⁄₂ by
4¹⁄₂ in. The latter should be a good
grade of very thin linen paper and
should be carefully prepared by dipping
it in hot paraffin. The sheets of tin foil
and paper in each unit are piled up alternately,
allowing about ¹⁄₂ in. on each
tin-foil strip to project beyond the paper
for making connections. The pile is
covered with heavy paper, and a heated
flatiron is passed on the top of each
unit until the paraffin begins to melt.
Upon cooling, the units are compact.</p>

<p>The connections necessary are shown
in the diagram. The condenser units
C, D, E, F, G, each have one side connected
to a common terminal A. The
other sides of the condensers are connected
to the copper strips H, J, K, L,
M. They are ¹⁄₂ in. wide and ¹⁄₁₆ in.
thick. A copper lever, ¹⁄₈ by ¹⁄₂ by 8
in., is pivoted on one end so that it will

<p class="caption">The Cork Clips Hold the Bromide Print in the Water
in a Vertical Position</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The difficulty of washing bromide
enlargements of the larger sizes has always
made the amateur hesitate to undertake
much of this kind of work. The
developing and fixing can be done with
comparative ease, because of the facility
with which the print can be kept
moving in a tray that is smaller in size
than the print itself, but washing is
such a long process that one’s patience
is exhausted before the hypo is completely
eliminated. Continuous handling
of a print for 30 minutes is tedious
work. This objection can be overcome
in the simplest and most efficacious
manner, as follows:</p>

<p>Procure some large corks of the best
quality and in each cut a groove completely
around it, near one end, to serve
as a retainer for a rubber band; then
cut the cork lengthwise through the
center, and cut a wedge-shaped piece
from the center toward the end opposite
the one where the groove was cut
for the rubber band. After placing a
band in the groove of the proper size
the combination will work similarly to
an old-fashioned spring clothespin.</p>

<p>If two of these are snapped on the
edge of a bromide print, this can be
dropped into a bathtub or laundry tub
for washing. The corks will cause the
print to float vertically in the running
water. By this means a number of

<h2 class="nobreak">Bench Support for a Miter Box</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>To make the most effective use of a
miter box, it must be fastened solidly
to a base, but if fastened to the workbench
top it is in the way when not in
use, and it is a nuisance to fasten and
unfasten the box every time it is used.
To avoid the changing, I mounted the
miter box on two pieces of 1 by 3-in.
stock, about 2 ft. long. These pieces
were placed on the bench top, at right
angles to the front edge and with their
centers as far apart as the two pairs of
legs on the box. The box was placed
on the front end of the pieces, with the
back parallel to the front of the bench,
at right angles to the pieces, and was
fastened to them with screws. The
other end of each piece was fastened
to the bench top with a hinge.</p>

<p>This fastened the miter box firmly
to the bench top, but in such a way
that I could tip it up and back against
the wall, or other support, where it was
out of the way but ready for use immediately.
To stiffen the frame, I placed
a cross brace between the two pieces,
making it in the form of the letter H.—Contributed

<h2 class="lrgr nobreak">New Method of Developing Roll Films<br>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> T. B. LAMBERT</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">M</span><span class="afterlargecap">any</span> devices have been made for
developing and fixing roll films.
There is the simple wholesale method
of the professional who hangs a weight
on one end of the film and lets it down
in a deep tank of developing fluid where
it hangs submerged from an upper
support until the development is complete.
Then the support, the film, and
attached weight are removed, dipped
into a similar tank of running water,
then to another tank of fixing solution,
and subsequently
washed and dried.</p>

<p>This is the only
practical plan
where there are
many such films
to be handled simultaneously,
but
the amateur who
has only one or
two rolls a week
cannot afford the
tanks, the space,
nor the expense
incident to such
a method. The film is usually drawn
back and forth through a developing
solution placed in a tray, and after
the development has proceeded far
enough, the same process used in
washing, then the hypo solution, and
finally through the last washing for
about 20 minutes, all making a tedious
process.</p>

<p>Some amateurs and a few professionals
who but occasionally develop
roll film use a mechanical device that
rolls the film into a light-proof package
which is inserted in a metal tank for
development and subsequent fixation.
This is a standard process, the apparatus
being on sale at all supply houses,
but it has its drawbacks.</p>

<div class="container w35emmax">

<img src="images/illo343b.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">An Ordinary Drinking Glass Used for Developing
Roll Films</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The following method is not only
simple but perfect in its operation and
requires no special apparatus, only a
tumbler or lemonade glass, and an ordinary
lead pencil for its operation. A
glass rod is preferable to the lead pencil,
and it is also convenient to have a
deep tin cup, or similar device, to
cover up the lemonade glass and
make it light-proof,
should it be
desirable to turn
on the white light
in the dark room.</p>

<p>Pour enough
developing solution
into the glass
tumbler to cover
completely the
roll of film when
it is standing on
end. In the dark
room open the
film roll, remove
the backing paper and the paper ends
on the film, run it through clear water
until it is thoroughly and uniformly
wetted from end to end, and drop it
endwise into the tumbler of developer.
Immediately insert the pencil or glass
rod into the center of the roll, and
with a rather quick circular motion,
move the rod around so that it will
quickly pass between the several convolutions
of the film and thus distribute
the developer all over its surface.
Repeat this operation at once, then
again in a few seconds, then in 15 or
20 seconds, then in 30 seconds, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page340">[340]</span>
in 1 minute, and so on, with greater
intervals of time. If a 20-minute developer
is used, it will only be necessary,
at the latter part of the development,
to separate the layers every 2 or 3
minutes.</p>

<p>When the development is complete,
pour off the solution and rinse in the
same glass by letting water run
through it while passing the pencil or
glass rod between the layers several
times. The water may then be drained
off, and the glass filled with the fixing
solution. While the film is fixing, the
glass rod should be passed between
the layers several times to renew the
solution in contact with the film.</p>

<p>It will be seen that at no time after
the first washing is it necessary to
handle the film, so that damage to the
film and staining the fingers are entirely
eliminated. Further than that,
no apparatus is tied up in the operation,
and if a light-proof cup is at hand,
the developing tumbler may be covered
between the operations of separating
the layers of film, and the white light
of the dark room can be turned on for
further operations.</p>

which forms the most delicate background
possible. It is laid on quite
thick at the bottom of the scene, gradually
thinning it toward the top. Be
careful to see that the fibers of the
down are placed so that they will radiate

of bowling except that it is played
on a small raised board, and, instead of
throwing the balls by hand, an ordinary

The automatic
feature of this new game saves the
time usually required to set up the pins,
and assures that they will be set absolutely

<img src="images/illo345c.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">The Alley Board
with Its
Attachments</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>To build this alley, first
procure three planed
boards, hard wood preferred,
though they are
more difficult to
work; two, 10 ft.
long, 9 in. wide, and
¹⁄₂ in. thick, and the
other, 10 ft. long, 15 in.
wide, and ¹⁄₂ in. thick.
Place the first two
boards side by side and
fasten them with cleats,
the first cleat being
placed 18 in. from the
end to be used for the
pins. The cleats should<span class="pagenum" id="Page342">[342]</span>
be of ³⁄₈ or ⁷⁄₈-in. material and cut as
long as the upper board is wide, or 15
in. These are placed on top of the
lower boards, or between the two. By placing
the first one 18 in. from the
end, clearance is obtained for the trap
A. The other board is placed on the
cleats and fastened, after it has been
centrally located, with screws from the
under side. The screws must not come
through or the surface of the upper
board be marred in any way so that
the balls cannot roll freely. The difference
in width of the lower board and
the upper one provides 1¹⁄₂-in. clearance
on each side as grooves for the
return of the balls.</p>

<p>Inclose the alley with boards, 3 in.
wide and ¹⁄₂ in. thick, to the point B,
and from there around the pin end with
boards, 6 in. wide. The upper board
should be cut to such a length that a
space of 2 in. at the end C will be provided.
Into this space is fitted a block
of wood, about ⁷⁄₈ in. thick, having its
upper surface slightly pitched toward
the sides of the alley to start the balls
back to the front of the board. From
the ends of this block two strips, 1¹⁄₂
in. wide, are fitted into the side grooves,
from D to E, on an incline, to return
the ball after each shot.</p>

<p>The location of each pin is marked
on the end of the upper board, and
small holes are drilled just large
enough to admit pieces of stout cord,
like a fishline, to pass through freely.
The pins are made of hard wood, carefully
balanced, so that one end will not
be heavier than the other. The lower
end of each pin is drilled to make a
recess, F, in which the cord is fastened
with a screw or nail. Holes are bored
through the bottom board, ³⁄₈ in. in
diameter, to correspond to the 10 small
holes made through the upper one.
Lead weights of about 2 oz. are fitted
in the holes and attached to the strings
from the pins. The ends of the weights
should extend about ¹⁄₂ in. from the
under side of the alley.</p>

<p>Attach a board, 18 in. square, with
hinges to the end of the alley so that
it will hang under the weights. A
stout cord is run along the under side
of the alley to the front end through
screw eyes, and attached to the swinging
board. By letting the board swing
down the weights are released and
they draw the pins into a standing position,
accurately set for the next
break. When set, the line is drawn,
and the swinging board pushes the
weights up and releases the pins.</p>

<p>The balls used are made of hard
wood, and, if it is not desirable to make
them, they can be purchased from a toy
store. They are 1¹⁄₄ in. in diameter.
Each player has three shots. The ball
is placed on the spot G and shot with
a billiard cue, the object being to
knock down as many pins as possible;
the score is kept as in bowling.</p>

<p>Horses can be made of metal and
wood, as shown, for holding the alley
at the proper height. The alley can be
used on a large table, but horses are
more convenient.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">The Glass-and-Hat Trick</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>The effect of this trick is as follows:
The performer first exhibits a small
table, about 2 ft. square, the top of
which is covered with black velvet. He
requests the loan of a Derby hat and a
handkerchief, then takes an ordinary
glass, filled with water, and places it on
the table top, covers it with the handkerchief,
and sets the hat on top of the
glass. He then withdraws a short distance,
and at a command, the glass appears
to pass slowly through both handkerchief
and hat until the hat rests on
the table top. The hat is then taken up
and is handed to the owner, who finds
the glass of water in the hat.</p>

<p>While this is seemingly impossible,
the effect can be easily accomplished
and the necessary apparatus can be
made up cheaply if a table of suitable
size can be had, although a kitchen table
may be used if so desired, but a table
about 2 ft. square is preferred, because
it can be easily carried. The table is
prepared as follows: Procure a block
of wood, about 2 in. square and 1¹⁄₂ in.<span class="pagenum" id="Page343">[343]</span>
thick, and glue it to the under side of
the table in the center. Bore a ¹⁄₄-in.
hole through both the table top and the
block of wood. The top of the table
must be covered with some black cloth,
such as velvet. Using the hole bored as
a center, cut out a piece of the table top
to correspond with the diameter of the
glass to be used, and about ¹⁄₈ in. deep,
fit into this depression a piece of round
sheet brass. Procure a ¹⁄₄-in. rod, about
6 in. long, and fasten the brass disk to
the end of it so that the disk will fit into
the round depression when the rod is
run through the hole in the table top
and block. The other, or lower, end of
the rod is filed flat, and a small hole is
drilled through it, the edges being
smoothed to receive a thread. The top
of the brass disk is covered with the
same material as is used for covering
the table top. This will make it appear
to be one piece covering the table top.
Fasten a strong black thread to one
corner of the table top on the under
side, and run it through the hole drilled
through the end of the rod, then over a
small window-curtain roller fastened
into the opposite corner of the table
top, where the thread is run down a
table leg and through another pulley
out under a rug or the floor to an assistant
where the thread will not be seen.
The metal disk can then be controlled
without any apparent power. If the
rod extends under the table too far,
tape some velvet or fancy cloth around
the table edge to cover it.</p>

<p class="caption">Apparently the Glass Filled with Water Passes Up
through the Crown of the Hat and is Taken

</div><!--container-->

<p>To begin the trick, the performer exhibits
the glass of water, then sets it
on the table just back of the disk, and
in placing the borrowed handkerchief
it is put on the disk rather than the
glass. As the handkerchief is held in
front of the glass the assistant pulls the
disk up; thus the handkerchief is placed
on the disk and the glass of water is left
uncovered just behind it. The performer
then starts to put the borrowed
hat on the glass, crown up, and when,
seeing his mistake, he apologizes, turns
the hat over, and in doing so picks up
the glass of water and places it in the
hat. The hat is then set on the disk
with the crown down. In turning the
hat the glass is taken up with the first
two fingers of the right hand. When
the hat is raised, the glass is also raised
with it, and while doing this the hat is
slanted so as to hide the glass. In turning
the hat over, the glass is brought
into it. This is quite hard to explain,
but a little practice will enable the performer
to make no mistake. When the
hat is placed on the disk the assistant
slowly lets the disk down. It is very
necessary to let the hat down slowly, as
a sudden jerk is apt to tumble the hat
over and spoil it as well as the trick.
When the hat comes to rest on the table
top, it is removed and handed to the
owner with the glass of water in it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A Magic Cabinet</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>The performer calls the attention of
his audience to a cabinet mounted on
short legs and having doors in the
front, back, and top. The back door is
opened, then the top and front, and an
arm is thrust through to show that the
cabinet is empty and without double
doors or double walls. The performer
also puts his wand beneath the box to
show that there is no deception there.
The doors are then closed, except the
top, and reaching down, he takes out
any number of articles, from handkerchiefs
to rabbits, and then the front
door is opened to show the box is
empty, but upon closing the front door
again, he is still able to produce articles
until the supply is exhausted. Wonderful
though this trick may appear, it
is very simple, and if a person is handy
with tools, it can be made from lumber
taken from a packing box.</p>

<p>To make the cabinet, nail together,
in the shape of a rectangle, two pieces,
16 in. long, 14 in. wide, and ¹⁄₂ in. thick,
and two pieces 14 in. square and ¹⁄₂ in.
thick. To one of the latter pieces fasten
four legs, one at each corner. In the
opposite piece, or the top, make an
opening in the center, 8 in. square.
This opening is covered with a door
8¹⁄₂ in. square, supplied with a knob to
open it easily. A piece, 16 in. long and
14 in. wide, with an attached knob, is
hinged to the front, for a door; also another
for the back hinged in the same
manner and with a knob. In the back
there is a cutout made, 9 in. long and
7 in. wide, in the center. In this opening
a swinging box is hung to hold the
articles taken from the cabinet. The
swinging box is made of two pieces, 9
in. long and 7 in. wide, and two pieces
about ¹⁄₂ in. larger each way, nailed together
on ends, cut triangular. This
box is hinged in the opening so that it
will swing in or out as desired and
show a panel on either side of the door.
The front door should have a panel
nailed on each side of equal size, to
make both doors appear alike.</p>

<p>After loading all the things desired
to be shown in the triangular box, start
the trick by pushing this box into the
cabinet and showing the outside; then
open the back, and in doing so, push
the triangular box out as the door
swings back and away from the audience.
This shows that there is nothing
to be seen but the panel. Open the
front door and top, and the cabinet will
appear empty. Close both front and
back doors, and in making this change,
push the triangular box in, and begin
to take the things out through the top
door.</p>

freely and the triangular box swing

it. With a clever performer
this trick is without an equal, as many
variations can be made in the performance.</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<div class="container w15emmax">

<img src="images/illo350c.jpg" alt="Home-made furnace">

</div><!--container-->

<p>A small gas furnace for melting
small quantities of gold, silver, or
other metals, can be easily made as
follows: Procure a cylinder of stovepipe
iron of the desired size, say 4¹⁄₂ or
5 in. in diameter, and 6 in. long. Turn
in the edge of one end so that it will
hold loosely a disk of iron of the same
thickness as the cylinder, to form the
bottom. Punch
¹⁄₈-in. holes,
about 1 in. apart,
all over the cylinder
and the
bottom. This is
to allow for the
escape of moisture
and air. Attach
three legs
to the sides with
rivets, evenly
spaced so as to
raise the bottom
4 in. In the side of the cylinder cut a
hole, 1¹⁄₄ in. in diameter, its center being
1¹⁄₂ in. from the bottom. Select
a glass bottle whose diameter is 1 or
1¹⁄₂ in. less than that of the cylinder.</p>

<p>Make a putty of fire clay, and add
about five per cent of plaster of Paris,
and also add about a teaspoonful of
vinegar, to prevent a too rapid setting.
Place a mass of the putty in the bottom
of the cylinder and press in the
bottle after its surfaces have been
well greased. The bottle should be
well centered in the cylinder. Press
the bottle well down, so that its bottom
is on a level with the lower edge
of the hole in the side. Fill in the
putty to form the sides, tamping it<span class="pagenum" id="Page347">[347]</span>
well all around the bottle, and build it
up a little above the metal of the sides,
carefully smoothing off the edge.
With the fingers, or a spatula of some
kind, cut out the putty in the hole to
form an opening, ³⁄₄ in. in diameter.
Allow the putty to set for more than
an hour, and then with a circular, or
twisting, motion remove the bottle.
To prevent a vacuum in the bottom
that will prevent removing the bottle
easily, puncture the putty that lies on
the disk with a hatpin, to allow the
air to pass.</p>

<p>A few places will be found where
the putty has not filled in properly,
and these should be patched up while
the filling is yet soft. The clay will
probably shrink after standing for a
time, and should be pressed out
against the sides while in a plastic
state. When dry, the furnace is ready
for use.</p>

<p>In furnaces of this kind the jet of a
large gas blowtorch is to be used. If
a standard is rigged up to hold the
blowtorch, it will be much easier for
the operator. The jet from the pipe is
thrown in the hole at the side and a
crucible is placed in the furnace. It
is well to make a cover similar to the
body of the furnace with a hole in the
center a little larger than the hole in
the side.</p>

<p>A more efficient furnace can be
made with two holes in the side, opposite
each other, for using a double
jet from blowtorches.—Contributed by

<h2 class="nobreak">The Magic Clock Hand</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>The hand, or pointer, is the only
working part needed to perform the
trick. A clockface can be drawn on
any piece of white paper, and a pin
stuck in its center on which the hand
revolves. The hand A is cut from a
piece of sheet brass, and may be in
any form or design desired, but it must
balance perfectly on the axle, which
passes through a ¹⁄₄-in. hole in the
center, or else the magic part will fail.
The illustration shows a good design
with dimensions that will cause it to
balance well; however, this can be adjusted
by removing some metal from
the end that is heavier with a file or
tinner’s snips, or a bit of solder may
be stuck to the lighter end.</p>

<p class="caption">Design of a Hand That will Balance Well and the
Parts for Its Axle</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>A disk, B, is cut from a piece of sheet
brass, 1¹⁄₈ in. in diameter, twelve ³⁄₃₂-in.
holes are drilled at equal distance
apart near the edge, and a ¹⁄₄-in. hole
is drilled in its center. This disk is
soldered to the hand where both ¹⁄₄-in.
holes will coincide. It is necessary to
procure two washers, C and D, that
are embossed, or raised, in the center,
and about 1¹⁄₄ in. in diameter. These
can be purchased from a dealer in curtain
rods, the rod parts wanted being
the washers used on the ends. A careful
mechanic can raise the center portion
of a brass disk by beating it over
a hole with a ball-peen hammer.</p>

<p>One of the washers, C, has a spring,
E, soldered at one end, and the other
carries a small projection that will engage
the holes in the disk, B. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page348">[348]</span>
projection can be made by driving the
metal out with a center punch, set on
the opposite side.</p>

<p>The washer D is provided with a
lead weight, F, and a ¹⁄₄-in. stud, G,
is soldered in the center. The stud has
a ¹⁄₁₆-in. hole drilled through its center
for the pin axle. The weight is made
by filling the washer with melted lead,
which when cold is removed and sawn
in two. One piece is then stuck in the
washer with shellac. The stud is ⁷⁄₈
in. long with the upper part, about ¹⁄₄
in. in length, filed, or turned down,
smaller, and threaded. Just below the
thread, or on the shoulder, the body is
filed square to fit a square hole filed
in the face washer C carrying the
spring. This square hole and stud end
are necessary in order that both
washers may turn together.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The dial can be made of a piece of
thick cardboard, or thin wood, with the
numbers from 1 to 12 painted on, like
a clockface. A pin, ¹⁄₁₆ in. in diameter,
or an ordinary large pin, is run through
the center so that it will project on
the face side on which the hand is to
revolve.</p>

<p>The washer D with the weight is
placed on the rear side of the hand
with the fixed stud run through the
hole in the center of the hand; then
the washer C is placed on the square
part of the stud, and the nut J, which
should have a round, knurled edge, is
turned on the threads. This will cause
the projection on the spring E to engage
one of the small holes on the
disk B. In turning the two washers,
C and D, with the thumb and first
finger of the right hand, the projection
snapping into the holes of the disk B
can be felt. The hand is placed on the
pin of the clockface, and the
washers are turned so that the
weight will make it point to
12. Scratch a mark on the
hand at H, also mark a line
on the front washer at this
point. These lines are necessary,
as they enable the performer
to know how many
holes to snap the spring over
to have the hand point at any
desired number.</p>

<p>By reversing the hand it will
point to a different number;
for instance, if set for 8 and
put on the pin backward, it
will point to 4, and so on, with
other settings. The dial can
be held in the hand, hung on
a stand, or fastened to a wall,
and can be used to tell the day
of the week, time of day, cards
selected, etc. The audience
can call for any number on the
clockface, and the setting of
the disks is an easy matter
while holding the hand, or pointer, in
the hands, so that it cannot be detected.</p>

which has the diameter of the finished
rod, is bored through the block. The
hole D is next bored at right angles to
the axis of the hole C, and so placed
that its edge just touches the outer
edge of the hole C. This hole is to receive

those interested in amateur theatricals
the following method of
showing dissolving views in the fire-light
of pipe dreams and mind pictures
will be appreciated.</p>

<p>A frame made of light material, A,
<a href="#Fig352">Fig. 1</a>, covered with red cloth and
chalked to represent brick, is placed in
the center of the stage. The central
opening, representing the fireplace,
must be rather large, about 12 ft. wide
and 7 ft. high, because it is at the back
of this opening that the pictures are
produced. From the chimney back, 2¹⁄₂
ft. behind this opening, the sides, B, of
the fireplace slope outward to the imitation
brickwork. The walls of the
fireplace are covered with sheet asbestos,
for safety, and painted black;
then ashes are rubbed on the chimney
back and scattered over the hearthstone,
to make the appearance more
realistic.</p>

<p>The chimney back is removable, in
fact it is one of a series of a half dozen
screens, the others being behind it, the
proper manipulation of which, together
with changing lights, gives to the audience
the effect of dissolving views of
the dreams that are being acted out
directly behind the screens.</p>

<div class="container w45emmax">

<img src="images/illo355b.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">The Tableau is Played Out behind the Screens and is Dimly Seen through the Fireplace Opening When the
Lights are Properly Controlled and the Screens Drawn Slowly</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The screens are carried in a light
frame, the top of which is shown in
<a href="#Fig352">Fig. 2</a>, with position of runs. The runs<span class="pagenum" id="Page352">[352]</span>
are made of narrow strips of wood,
fastened to the under side of two end
pieces, for the screen frames to slide in.
Corresponding strips are placed in a
suitable position on the floor, to keep
the screens steady in sliding. The
frames holding the run pieces are
longer than the chimney back is wide,
and the upper one is placed as high as
the brickwork, the shelf, or mantel,
over the fireplace being an extension of
the upper part, or frame. The screens
are in pairs, as shown in <a href="#Fig352">Fig. 3</a>, each
one extending to the center of the fireplace.
They consist of light frames
covered with black mosquito netting.
The upper and lower sides of the
frames are sandpapered smooth so that
they will move easily in the runs. The
vertical sides of a pair of screen frames
that meet in the center of the fireplace
are made of one strand of wire, instead
of wood, so that their motion will not
be noticeable. To complete the apparatus,
andirons and a gas log are
needed in the fireplace, and whatever
arrangements are necessary for the action
of the views to be shown behind
the screens.</p>

<p>If gas is available, an asbestos log is
used in the fireplace, and it has a connecting
pipe to the footlights, where
four or five jets are located on the floor
just back of the screens. A narrow
board, painted black, is placed in front
of the lights, which should be wide
enough to conceal the lights from the
spectators and reflect the light on the
tableau. If the light is thrown above

be made higher.</p>

<p>In most halls, and some houses, electric
lights are used instead of gas, and
in this case ordinary logs are piled in
the fireplace on the andirons, and one
or more red globes are introduced to
produce the effect of glowing embers.
The gas is more effective, however, because
it is not easy to get a gradual
rise and fall in the glow of electric
lights. Four or five footlights are
sufficient.</p>

<p class="caption long">Frames Made of Light Material and Covered with Black Mosquito Netting Serve as Screens Which are
Operated in Runs Located behind the Fireplace That is Made Up in a Like
Manner and Penciled to Represent Brick</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The working of the dissolving views
can be best explained by an illustration
from “Reveries of a Bachelor.”
The gas log is turned low to make
the stage dimly lighted, and the tableau
to be shown is all arranged behind the
chimney back and the screens. There
should be barely sufficient light to
reveal the bachelor on the hearthstone
smoking in the gloaming. Then the
chimney back almost imperceptibly
parts, that is, the screens of the first
pair are gradually pulled apart, the
footlights and gas log are gradually
turned on, and the tableau behind the
fireplace, being more brightly illuminated,
is dimly seen through the series
of screens. Slowly the successive pairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page353">[353]</span>
of screens are drawn aside, and the
tableau becomes quite distinct. Then
the process is reversed, the screens are
gradually replaced, the lights are lowered
and the dream fades away; brightens
and fades again; brightens and
fades, till gone entirely. The screens
are always slowly moving while the
tableau is exposed, and this makes the
illusory effect. It is evident that the
success of this plan depends principally
on the coördination with which the
screens are operated. “Cinderella,” and
many other tales based on the vagaries
of the mind and having their source in
glowing embers, can thus be presented.</p>

Plates</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Often the amateur turns out a very
workmanlike piece of apparatus, which
only lacks the addition of a scale or
name plate to give it a truly professional
appearance. I recently hit upon
an excellent method of making these
articles in a manner that will stand
considerable wear and at the same time
present a very good appearance.
Simply take a piece of good Bristol
board and letter it as desired with
waterproof drawing ink, then apply a
coat of clear varnish, such as is used
on bird’s-eye maple furniture. After
not less than 24 hours rub lightly with
fine steel wool, wipe clean, and revarnish.
Usually two coats are sufficient,
and the last should be rubbed with a
soft oily rag dipped in some abrasive
material such as tooth powder, or one
of the many powders used for metal
polishing. Finally polish with a little
oil, and the result will be a perfect imitation
of celluloid.—Contributed by

<h2 class="lrgr nobreak">Magic Candles Explained<br>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> CLIFFORD WAYNE</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">C</span><span class="afterlargecap">lever</span> and baffling though it may
be, the magic-candle trick may
be performed easily and with professional
skill by a person who has
made a few simple preparations. The
illustration shows the candles arranged
on a table made of a music stand.</p>

<p>Candles, cigars, or pencils may be
used, but for the purpose of this
description the
former will be
used. The candles
are of different
colors but of
the same size and
weight. The manipulation
is as
follows:</p>

<p>Exhibit a tube
of brass, cardboard,
or other
suitable material,
just large enough
to contain a candle.
Then retire
from the room,
leaving the tube
on the table while
one of the spectators
selects one of
the candles and
places it into the
tube, covering the
end of the latter
securely with a
small cap. The other candles are hidden
before the performer is permitted to return.
The trick is to announce the
color of the candle contained in the
box by merely passing the hand over
it several times. The box and candle
are passed out for inspection and will
bear it if properly prepared.</p>

<p>The secret of the trick is this: The
first candle, for example, the white one,
is unprepared. The second, a blue one,
has concealed in it, ¹⁄₂ in. from the top,
a small piece of magnetized steel. The
third candle, a red one, has a similar
bar concealed at the middle; the fourth,
a magnetized bar ¹⁄₂ in. from the bottom,
and the fifth candle has the bar
at a point halfway
between the middle
and the bottom.
The candles
are made of wood
and the magnets
may readily be
imbedded in
them. They are
made of two
pieces glued together
like a pencil.</p>

<div class="container w30emmax">

<img src="images/illo359b.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">Mysterious Passes over the Concealed Candle are
Made and Its Color Announced</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The performer
hides a small compass
in his palm.
It is held in place
by a wire clip,
gripped between
the second and
third fingers near
the knuckles. A
wave of the hand
over the tube containing
a candle
will affect the
compass if any candle other than the
white one is used. Its needle will vibrate
when approaching the concealed
magnet, and by determining quickly
the position of the magnet, the color
may be announced.</p>

<p>Those who offer guesses usually insist
that some electrical device is used.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A Carbon Electric Water Heater</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>The water heater illustrated is for
use on a 110-volt circuit without added
resistance. It consists of two electrodes
which are
immersed directly
in the water;
and while it is
not as artistic as
the usual nickelplated
heater, it
is usually more
economical and has the distinct
advantage that it cannot
be burnt out. It may be
made as rapid in action as
desired, is inexpensive and
very convenient where water
is required for experimental or industrial
purposes.</p>

<div class="container w20emmax">

<img src="images/illo360c.jpg" alt="Details of carbons for water heater">

</div><!--container-->

<p>For the electrodes, procure two ¹⁄₂-in.
uncoppered carbons, and drill a hole
in the top of each of these so that feed
wires can be attached. The handle is
shaped from a piece of hard wood. The
lower end is hollowed out half round
at either side, so that the carbons will
fit in snugly. Four small holes are
then drilled through from side to side
for binding wires, and a large hole is
made in the center for the feed wires.
Two smaller branch holes are then
drilled to join the center hole, so that
the double feed cord may be branched
out to reach both electrodes. The
outer edge of the handle is neatly
rounded off and boiled in paraffin so
as to render it impervious to moisture.</p>

<p>Remove sufficient insulation from
the feed cord to make a good connection<span class="pagenum" id="Page357">[357]</span>
with the carbons. Fish the wire
through the handle from the upper end.
Pull each of the two ends pretty well
through, so that they can be securely
threaded into the holes previously made
in the carbons. Have the latter quite
hot and run in as much solder as possible,
forcing it in with the end of a
match as it becomes plastic. Remove
all traces of the flux, and paint the
connection with some melted pitch,
taken from the top of a discarded dry
cell. The feed cord may then be pulled
up tightly, which will draw the carbons
in place. They are then bound by
threading through several strands of
copper wire. If the holes in the wood
are slightly countersunk, and two
small grooves filed around each carbon
at the right places to let the holding
wires in, the binding feature may be
disposed of very neatly.</p>

<p>In some localities the water is so free
from all mineral salts that it will not
carry the current freely, which means
that the electrodes must be placed
closer together, or else a small pinch
of common salt may be added to the
water. Although, in sterilizing instruments,
boiling eggs, or something of
that sort, this would be of no advantage,
the salt greatly hastens the
boiling.</p>

spring at L1. The spring is bent
at a right angle at its other end, L2,
and carries a platform, L3, strengthened
by a smaller disk underneath.
The dancer performs upon this platform.</p>

<p>A contact spring, S, is carried by the

is adjustable in its contact with the
spring S. A wire runs from the contact
screw to the binding post B, to

<p>Spanish cedar or mahogany is suitable
for the neck, detailed in <a href="#Fig359">Fig. 3</a>.
A single piece is best, but the extension
for the pegs and the wider end
at the body may be joined and glued
to the main portion of the neck. Dowels
should then be used to reinforce
the joints. The outline of the parts of
the neck are shown in detail in Fig. 3.
In the sectional view at the right, the
shape of the neck at the thinnest and
thickest parts is shown by the two
upper curved, dotted lines. The nut
D is made of mahogany, walnut, or
other hard wood, the grain extending
lengthwise, and the notches for the
strings spaced as shown.</p>

<p>The making and spacing of the frets
must be done very carefully. They are
of aluminum, brass and other metals
being suitable also. Make the frets ¹⁄₁₆
by ³⁄₁₆ in. and cut grooves ¹⁄₈ in. deep
for them. The spacing of the frets is
determined as follows, a standard
practice: The distance from the metal
string-contact on the bridge to the nut
should be measured carefully. The
first fret, near the head, is ¹⁄₁₈ of this
distance from the nut, the total length
being in this instance, 13 in. The second
fret is set ¹⁄₁₈ the distance from
the first fret to the bridge; the third,
¹⁄₁₈ from the second fret to the
bridge, etc. The frets must fit tightly
in the grooves, requiring no special
fastening. The tuning pegs may be
bought or made.</p>

<p>In assembling the parts, fasten the
end of the body to the neck, with glue,
reinforced by screws. Set its upper
edge parallel with the fingerboard, and
so that the latter is flush with the top of
the body, when fitted to it. Assemble
the body, without the top, gluing it to
the end, fixed to the neck. When this
portion is thoroughly dried, fit the top
into place finally, and glue it. The
whole construction is then cleaned,
sandpapered, stained, and shellacked or
varnished. The stringing of the instrument
is simple, and the strings may
be purchased in sets.</p>

afforded by making a coop as
shown in the illustration. It consists
of an outer frame of boards, 1 ft. wide
and 6 ft. long, or as long as desired for
the runway. The frame is divided into
compartments by boards extending
from end to end, each compartment
being for one hen. The frame is
placed on level ground and staked in
place. At opposite ends of each compartment
is a hinged cover. The intervening
space is covered with wire
netting, with shelter boards placed
loosely over it. Under one of the
hinged covers the nest should be
placed on the ground, and at the opposite
end food and water are provided.
Each hen has plenty of space to exercise
in, and must at least get up for
food and water. The individual covers
permit separate examination of the
eggs, or feeding of the hens.—F. W.
Buerstatte, Pullman, Wash.</p>

Increasing Draft</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>While sitting in a room around a
lamp, a group of workmen discussed
the probable causes for the smoking
of an oil lamp. By way of experiment,
holes were punched in the perforated
part of the burner, increasing the draft
through the glass chimney. It was
then possible to turn the light up
much higher, without the usual deposit
of smoke. As a result of this,
several other troublesome lamps were
soon remedied.—J. E. McCormack,

<p>The mold is of plaster of Paris, held

plain block or anything that will produce
an impression of the general outline
of the casting, as shown in the
sketch. After the impression is made
the mold should be dusted thoroughly
with black lead. The journal bearings
are then located, holes drilled in the
hardened plaster and wood pins set
as shown. These pins must be of hard
wood and of a diameter to suit the finished
size of the bore. Brass tubing
of a suitable size is cut off to the
length required and placed on the
wood pins. These pieces of tubing
will be the brass bushings in the finished
castings. Babbitt metal is
melted and poured into the mold. Before
pouring the metal it is well to be
sure that the plaster is thoroughly dry.</p>

<p>The mold is as shown, and the upper
side of the metal is at all times exposed
to the air. This makes it necessary
to have all core prints on the
under side, as this side will be the
one in view when the casting is finished,
and the upper side, as the casting
lies in the mold, will be the inside
or unexposed side. In case of curved
work, reinforcing strips of sheet brass
should be placed in the mold and imbedded

</div><!--container-->

<p>I first secured an ordinary soap box
and took it apart, being careful to keep
the boards whole, then rebuilt it to
make a box with ends measuring 12
in. square, and 14 in. in length. In one
end I cut a large hole to admit a 60-watt
tungsten globe, then, taking another
board, I fitted a knob and hinges
to it and used it for a door. The other
end of the box was centered and a hole
bored large enough to admit an ordinary
socket. Another hole was bored,
4 in. to the right, for another socket.
A much heavier material was used for
the lid than for the box, being at least
⁷⁄₈ in. thick. A piece of double-strength,
clear glass, 8 by 10 in. in size,
was procured and set in a hole cut in
the cover so that its upper surface
would be flush.</p>

<p>An ordinary single-pole switch was
secured, as shown in <a href="#Fig375a">Fig. 1</a>, also a
small mousetrap, as shown in <a href="#Fig375a">Fig. 2</a>.
The front part of the trap was sawed
off so that only the spring was utilized.
The base of the trap was then cut out
to fit snugly on the base of the switch,
into which two corresponding holes
were bored for the screws. The next
thing was to secure several clips,
which were cut from sheet brass, to
operate the switch, and a lever to control
the switch, as shown in <a href="#Fig375a">Fig. 3</a>.
The lever is 1 in. wide and 4 in. long,
having a slot at the bottom, to slip
easily over the lever handle in the
switch, and a hole, drilled 1 in. above
the slot, to admit a nail to keep the
spring from throwing it out of position.

When the cover B is lowered,

</div><!--chapter-->

<div class="illocap379">

<img src="images/illo383b.jpg" alt="V" title="V">

</div><!--illocap-->

<p><span class="afterillocap379">ery</span> few persons
realize that
the smoke issuing
from chimneys
is mainly
coal gas carrying
minute particles of
unconsumed carbon
that gives it a
dark-gray color, containing,
besides, some
sulphur and sulphuric gases,
carbonic-acid gas, and other
impurities. It is only necessary
to collect the impurities to get a gas that
will burn with a bright flame.</p>

<p>The products obtained from a gas
plant are gas, ammoniacal liquor, coal
tar, and coke. Of 1 ton of coal, 1,500
lb. remains in the retort, or furnace, as
coke; 20 gal. of ammoniacal liquor and
140 lb. of coal tar are taken from the
cylinders and washers. When distilled,
the ammoniacal liquor will yield close
to 18 gal. of ammonia, which is used in
the manufacture of artificial ice and
cold storage. The coal tar will yield
approximately 19 lb. of benzol, which
is the base of all true aniline dyes; 6
lb. of naphthalene, commonly known
as camphor flakes or moth balls, which
also yields some dyes; 4 lb. of toluene,
which is valuable as a solvent and is
the base of saccharine, and about 2 lb.
each of phenol (carbolic acid), pyrene,
anthracene, xylenol, cresol, chrysene,
and alizarin. The residuum is coal-tar
pitch, used extensively as a binder for
briquetting coal dust for household
consumption, and also for roofing and
street paving. From these various
coal-tar products, dyes of every tint,
shade and color are obtained, as well as
other industrial chemicals, from flavoring
extracts to perfumes, from volatile
oils to high explosives, and from the
sweetest of all sweets to the bitterest of
bitter.</p>

<p>A model gas plant—one that will be
instructive and in no way dangerous if
proper precautions are taken—can be<span class="pagenum" id="Page380">[380]</span>
built from a few fire brick, some pieces
of pipe, and a few tin cans. Enough
fire brick must be secured to build a
furnace 14 in. square by 20 in. high, inside
measurements. Build up the four
walls on a level surface of the ground,
laying the bricks with a cement mortar
to seal them perfectly, as coal gas will
find any small crevice and escape. For
this reason it is best to build a second
wall outside of the first and plaster the
joint between them as it is built. When
the four walls are finished, make a
grate of fire brick in the bottom by setting
the brick on edge and spacing
them about ¹⁄₄ in. After the walls are
dry, make ready the material for the
fire. Place sufficient kindling on the
grate to start a quick fire, then cover it
with coal. When this is done, cover
the furnace with a heavy piece of asbestos
board large enough to reach the
outside edge of the furnace walls. The
board must be cemented to the top surface
of the brick walls. Place the cement
mixture on the wall top, then
press the board on it, and place a
weight on top until the cement becomes
dry. The cement mixture should consist
of one part cement to two parts
of fine sand.</p>

<p>Procure a large can, such as used in
canning tomatoes, having a diameter
of more than 4 in. and with top and
bottom whole; also two other cans,
each having a capacity of 2 gal. with
closed heads. Connect the first can to
the furnace with a piece of 2-in. pipe, as
shown in the illustration. The pipe
can be bent for convenience, but in case
such a piece is not at hand, regular pipe
connections can be made with threaded
ends, ells, waste nuts, etc. In either
case, be sure to make the joints gas-tight.
If a bent pipe is used, the ends
can be cemented in the asbestos furnace
top and the can top. Cut a hole
centrally in the asbestos top and at one
side in the can top. Fit one end of the
pipe in the hole made in the asbestos
and seal the connection with asbestos
cement, then do likewise with the end
that enters the can top.</p>

<p class="caption">The Furnace Made of Fire Brick is Connected to the Condenser and Washers with Ordinary Iron Pipe
through Which the Gases Pass After being Purified Before They Enter the Storage Tank</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>In connecting the first and second
cans, use a piece of 1-in. pipe. This may
be bent or connected with ells to form
a U-shaped piece. In either case, one
end should be longer than the other
so that one will just pass into the first
can, where it is sealed with asbestos
cement, while the other end passes
through the second-can top, where it is
sealed, and extends to the bottom of
the can. For the connection to the
third can, make a hole in the top of the
second can, but do not seal it up to the
connection until the can is first filled
with water to within 2 or 3 in. of the
top. Also put powdered coke into the
water, about halfway of the can’s
height.</p>

<p>The connection from the second and
third cans should be made of glass so
that the gas can be observed passing
through it between the cans. This is
not absolutely necessary, however, and
a piece of ¹⁄₂-in. iron pipe can be used
instead. This pipe is connected in the
same manner as that between the first
and second, extending to the bottom of
the third can and being sealed where it
passes through the tops. The third can
is filled with water to within 2 or 3 in.
of the top.</p>

<p>The gas coming from the third can
or washer, is ready for use, but as the
pressure would not be uniform, a storage
tank must be provided. To make
a storage tank suitable for the needs
of this small plant, procure two pans
from 10 to 12 in. in diameter and from
3 to 4 in. deep. One pan should be a
trifle smaller, so that it may be inverted
in the larger pan, as shown. Make a
connection from the third can with a
rubber hose to the bottom of the larger
pan, near the center, and use this pan
as the bottom part of the storage tank.
Pour into this pan enough water to
make it 2 in. deep, invert the other pan
and set it into the water. Attach a gas
hose to the bottom of the inverted pan
and fasten a gas jet into the rubber-hose
end. This will make the gas plant
complete and ready to operate.</p>

<p>To start the furnace, bore a hole in
one side of the brick walls, about the
size of an ordinary lead pencil, and insert
a lighted taper to set fire to the
kindling. There may be some difficulty<span class="pagenum" id="Page381">[381]</span>
in getting the fire to burn at first,
and it may be necessary to force considerable
air in; however, when the fire
is fairly started, it will burn freely and
the gases will soon find their way
through the first pipe to the condenser,
which is the first can. There they will
mingle and deposit some tar and ammonia,
then flow out through the second
pipe, up through the coke and
water in the second can and through
the glass tube, where they may
be observed passing into the can of
water, where some more tar and ammonia
will be deposited. After leaving
this can the gas will find its way
through the rubber tube into the storage
tank. It passes from this tank to
the burner, where it can be lighted and
will burn with a bright flame.</p>

<p>If it is possible to force steam into
the furnace when the fire is at its
height, a much better quality and a
larger volume of gas will be made.
This is accomplished by placing a
closed can of water over a fire near the
furnace and connecting it to the latter
with a piece of 1-in. gas pipe. The
water in this can must be boiling hot
at the time the fire in the furnace is
lighted. The steam entering the furnace
is decomposed, the hydrogen being
released as a gas. The pipe connecting
the boiler with the furnace
should be fitted in the furnace wall so
that the steam will pass in at the top
of the fire; about halfway up the side
of the furnace being about right. The
steam will start the gases more rapidly
and force them through the pipes.</p>

<p>Make sure that all connections are
carefully sealed to prevent the escape
of gases, as they will always follow the
lines of least resistance and pass out
through a very small crevice. The only
danger with a plant of this size is from
fire, wherefore it should be built away
from inflammable materials. It will
not make sufficient gas to be of injury
to any living being.</p>

<h2 class="lrgr nobreak">A Miniature Cement Plant<br>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> MORTON SOUTHARD</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">F</span><span class="afterlargecap">or</span> many years geologists searched
for a substance which could be
molded into any size and form, and
would have the hardness of rock. As
a matter of fact it was found that limestone
was composed of carbonic-acid
gas, clay, and lime, and that when
great heat was applied the sealing bond
was disrupted and the rock was reduced
to a powder. When this powder
was placed in
water the gas was
set free so fast
that it made the
water boil. The
powder, or calcined
rock, is now
known as lime.
This action demonstrated
that nature
used heat and
moisture in forming
these materials
into rock.
Knowing that
clay contained
silica, and that
silica furnished
the sealing quality
of rocks, experiments
were made
to reverse the
order of this rock formation, and a cement
was produced. Equal portions of
lime and clay were mixed together and
stirred until all parts were thoroughly
mingled, and then the mixture was subjected
to a very high heat, after which
the resulting mass was ground to a
powder. When this powder was mixed
with water, instead of the gases passing
off as they did in the case of the
lime, they penetrated the clay and the
mixture became hard. This was first
called Portland cement, as it was made
from Portland limestone.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>This discovery partly solved the
problem of artificial-rock making, but
not wholly, for the best makes will
break, peel, and crack without the
slightest cause and when least expected,
and besides its dark-gray color
and rough appearance is unattractive.
Much progress has been made with
cement for interior
decorations
and many of the
finest marbles are
closely imitated.
This grade of
cement will not
weather and its
use is confined
wholly to interior
work. A white
cement is much
desired and many
of the large manufacturers
maintain
laboratories where
experiments are
carried on constantly
in the endeavor
to produce
it.</p>

<p>To build a miniature
cement plant, first secure sufficient
common brick to make a furnace
with an inside cavity, 20 in. square
and 24 in. high. Two sides and one
back wall are built up, sealing the
brick with mortar, clay, or cement.
The bottom is covered with bricks
standing on edge, and so placed that
they will be about ¹⁄₄ in. apart, to serve
as a grate. The top is then covered
with a piece of tin, or asbestos, and a
hole is cut in its center to receive a<span class="pagenum" id="Page384">[384]</span>
pipe, about 3 in. in diameter, for a
chimney. This chimney should be
about 15 in. high. Build the front wall
halfway up by laying the brick loosely
together so that the fire will get the air
through the crevices, then cover the
grate with kindling, place coal on top
of it, and start the fire. When it is well
under way, place a few fair-sized lumps
of limestone on top of the fire and complete
the wall to the top by laying the
brick as closely as possible. Use sufficient
coal to burn at least two hours.</p>

<p>When the fire has burned itself out
and the furnace has cooled, remove the
front wall and take out the burned
limestone. Some parts of the limestone
will be mixed with the coal, but most
of it will remain in the lump, which is
known as “black lime,” and when it is
placed in water it will give off gas very
fast. Obtain some fire clay and thoroughly
mix equal portions of lime and
clay, then place the mixture in a one-piece
pan, made of pressed tin or sheet
iron, as a soldered-bottom pan will
come apart with the heat. Build up the
front of the furnace as before, build a
fire and place the pan on the fire and
let it burn itself out. When the furnace
has cooled, remove the front, take
out the pan, and pulverize the mass in
the pan. When this powder is placed
in water it will become hard. If some
sand or gravel is mixed with it, and the
mortar thus formed is spread out over
a flat surface, a miniature cement sidewalk
will be the result.</p>

<h2 class="lrgr nobreak">A Tuberculosis Cottage<br>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> N. F. FULTZ</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>The tuberculosis society of a certain
locality needed a demonstration cottage
for their crusade against the white
plague, and they placed their need before
the boys of the public-school shops.
One class of eighth-grade boys volunteered,
and two days after the job was
started the complete cottage was delivered
to the society. The material
required for its construction was as
follows:</p>

<table class="stufflist blankabove75">

<tr>
<td class="right top">220</td>
<td class="text">linear feet of ship-lap, 1 in. thick and 6 in. wide.</td>

<td class="text">ft. of sheathing boards.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="right top">100</td>
<td class="text">ft. of tar roofing paper.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p class="blankbefore75">The cottage is constructed in sections
and can be assembled or dismantled in
30 minutes. The sections are not so
heavy but that they can be handled
with ease by two men. There are seven
sections, namely, the floor, two
sides, two ends, and two roof sections.
If the cottage is to be moved
only a short distance, it
can be loaded into an ordinary
dray assembled.</p>

<p>Since the building is
made in sections, it is
well to construct the
floor first, which is a
simple matter. Cut two
sills of the 2 by 4-in.

these onto the ends of
the five joists, which are
cut from 2 by 4-in.
stock, to a length that
will total 8 ft. when the
thickness of the two
sills are added. Lay the flooring the
long way of the section, bringing it
flush with all outside edges. This completes
the floor section.</p>

<p>The two side sections are made in a
similar manner. Cut the studs—12 of
them—6 ft. 4 in. long, and four plates,
10 ft. long. Cap the ends of the studs
with the floor and rafter plates, according
to the measurement on the floor
plan. Nail five pieces of ship-lap, cut
10 ft. 1¹⁄₂ in. long, on the bottom of the
section, and one similar board to the
top edge. Bore four holes, ³⁄₈ in. in
diameter, 1 in. from the outside edge in
the floor plate. These are for ¹⁄₂-in.
lag screws, to hold the parts together
when the sections are assembled.</p>

<p>The front-end section is arranged for
a 30-in. door. The top, or rafter, plate
is cut 7 ft. 4¹⁄₂ in. long. This makes the
allowance for the width of the side
studs and plates when they are to be assembled,
a very important matter to
remember. The floor plate is cut 4 ft.
5 in. long. Provide a dummy,
made from a waste
piece, to be fastened at
the bottom of the door
studs until the sections are assembled,
when it is removed. Use screws to
fasten this piece in place. Nail five
pieces of ship-lap, 5 ft. long, at the bottom
of the section, and an 8-ft. piece at
the top. Be careful to set the end studs
in from the end of the board the exact
thickness of the corresponding studs on
the side section.</p>

<p>The back-end section is much more
easily made. The top plate, as well as
the floor plate, is cut the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page386">[386]</span>
as on the other section. Place the
intermediate stud on the center and
nail on ship-lap, as in the other construction.</p>

<p>In making the roof sections, cut four
rafters for an 18-in. pitch, or any other
pitch desired. These are to be placed
at the ends. Note the notch on the
lower end of the rafter marked A in the
<a href="#Fig387">illustration</a>. Make allowance for the
thickness of the rider marked C. This
piece can be made of 2 by 4-in. stock
or any convenient material 1 in. thick.
The rider must be nailed to the comb
end of the rafters of one section, while
a dummy, fastened to the under side of
the rafters of the other section, will
serve the purpose of holding them true
until the roof is placed. Nail the sheathing
on, closing the cracks between the
boards as well as possible. Start at the
comb end and bevel the first board for
the comb joint. Make allowance for an
8-in. board at the lower end, so that a
4-in. overhang may be had. Cover these
sections with the desired roofing. Place
two screw holes at the lower end of
each rafter to be used in holding the
roof in place. Always use screws instead
of nails, if the house is to be dismantled.
Provide three rafter locks,
marked B, and then the roof is ready
for assembling.</p>

<p>The three gable boards, cut from
ship-lap, can be more easily made after
the cottage is assembled. After they
are fitted, each board must be fastened<span class="pagenum" id="Page387">[387]</span>
with screws which will find a hold in
the rafters. These boards are marked
D. Be sure that all lag-screw holes
for the corner and floor moorings are
bored before starting to assemble the
parts.</p>

<p>The screens are made with the half-lap
construction at the corners reinforced
with angle plates. This construction
is shown in the detail sketch.
The screens, or storm wings, should be
covered with a good grade of oilcloth or
canvas. They are hung with an ordinary
3-in. wing hinge.</p>

<p>The adjusting device for these storm
wings consists of a piece of 1-in. gas
pipe, 4 ft. long, threaded on one end to
receive a collar. Two flanges are used,
one on each side of the board, above the
wings and located centrally. A wood
plug is driven into the outer end of the
pipe, and a small pulley, suitable for a
³⁄₈-in. rope, hung on it. Place a screw
eye centrally into the lower edge of the
wing and tie the end of a ³⁄₈-in. rope to
it. Run the other end of the rope
through the pulley and a hole in the
wall. Place screw eyes, to which the
rope may be tied, at proper places on
the inside of the wall boards. An ordinary
screen door is hung in the door
opening.</p>

<p>It is often very difficult when focusing

especially when the negative is dim

and a perfect focus quickly determined
by the use of a focusing

fixed without being exposed, and when
dry, rule lines on it with India ink to
form small squares. To make the ink
adhere to the film, dust the latter with
talcum powder.</p>

<p>To use the screen, slide the film to be
enlarged in place and set it for the size
of enlargement, focusing roughly. Remove
the film or plate and put the
screen in its place. The camera may
now be brought to a perfect focus with
ease, as the black lines show up sharp
and clear on the screen. When the
focus has been determined the screen
is removed and the film replaced.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Ask any Canadian Indian what a
snow snake is, and he will tell you that
it is a piece of twisted wood, such as a
wild grape vine,
about 5 or 6 ft.
long, and 1 in. or
over in thickness,
stripped of its
bark and polished.
It is grasped with
one hand in the
center and given a
strong forward
throw at the tail
end by the other hand, while at the
same time the hold in the center is loosened.
With a hard bottom and about 1
in., or more, of
light snow on top—ideal
conditions
for playing the
game—the Indian
snake will travel
for a long distance
when thrown by
an expert, and to
a novice seeing
the snake traveling
along at a
rapid speed, raising
and lowering<span class="pagenum" id="Page389">[389]</span>
its head as the wood vibrates from
side to side, its resemblance to the real
reptile is perfect.</p>

<p>When the Indians have tests of skill
with the snake they make tracks
through the snow by drawing a log
in it, and sometimes as many as a
dozen tracks are made side by side, and
a dozen snakes are sent along at once.
The one who makes his snake emerge
from the end of the track first the most
times out of a certain number of
throws, takes the prize. The trick of
throwing the snake is not at all hard
to acquire, and it makes an exciting

<h2 class="nobreak">Storage of Wood for Cabinetwork</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>When working with wood to be
made into furniture, or other constructions
of a high grade of workmanship,
the ends of the finished pieces should
be shellacked in order to prevent moisture
from entering the ends. The ends
are more susceptible to moisture, as
the pores of the wood are exposed.
The application of this remedy will
often prevent warping or winding of
boards, which is particularly distressing
after a piece has been shaped to its
final size.</p>

<p>The pieces should be stored in a
warm, dry room, and in any event care
should be taken that they are exposed
evenly. If a board is placed on the
top of a pile of similar pieces, it will
be noted that, if left overnight and the
weather becomes rainy, the upper
piece will be warped. This is caused
by the absorption of moisture on the
upper side, the resulting expansion
forcing the piece to warp or curve.</p>

<p>Long pieces of wood under process
should be set on end while being
stored temporarily. The permanent
storage should be in racks having supports
about 2 ft. apart. If the supports
are too far apart, the boards may warp
or wind at intervening points. Boards
in piles should be separated by strips
about 1 in. thick, set about 3 ft. apart,
in order that the lumber may be open
to the air. This will keep the stock
more uniformly dry.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">To Determine the Efficiency of Electrically
Heated Devices</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<div class="container w30emmax">

<img src="images/illo394.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">Connections to the Voltmeter and Ammeter for
Measuring the Input to an Electric Heater</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The efficiency of any machine is defined
as being the ratio of the output
to the input expressed as a percentage,
and both quantities must be measured
in the same units. For example, the
output of a motor is 10 hp. when the
power taken by the motor from the
electric circuit to which it is connected
is 9,325 watts. What is the efficiency?
Since the output must be expressed in
the same units it is necessary to change
the 10 horsepower to watts or the 9,325
watts to horsepower. There are 746
watts in each horsepower. The 9,325
watts are equivalent to 9,325 ÷ 746 or
12.5 hp. The efficiency is then equal
to 10 ÷ 12.5 or .8; that is, the output is
.8 of the input or, when multiplied by
100 to change it to percentage, 80 percent.</p>

<p>By way of an example, consider the
efficiency of an electric heater, like the
one shown in the illustration, which is
immersed in water placed in a suitable
vessel. The energy input to this heater
in a given time may be easily determined
by measuring the current
passing through the heater circuit and
the difference in pressure between the
terminals of the heater. These measurements
may be made, in case the
heater is operated on a direct circuit,
by means of any ammeter and voltmeter
of suitable capacity, connected
as shown. If the heater is operated on
an alternating-current circuit, only
alternating-current instruments can be
used, as certain types of instruments
will not operate when connected to
such a circuit. In either case, the
product of the ammeter reading in amperes
and the voltmeter reading in
volts will give the power taken by the
heater in watts, assuming the heater
winding to be noninductive. If the
heater winding is not noninductive,
then the current and the electrical pressure
will no longer be in phase when
the device is operating on an alternating-current
circuit, and a wattmeter
must be used. Practically all heating
elements are wound noninductively so
that the power may be measured by
means of an ammeter and voltmeter.</p>

<p>The energy taken by a heater in a
given time will be equal to the product
of the average power and the time.
For example, if the heater takes 300
watts for 30 minutes—¹⁄₂ hour—then
the energy consumed is equal to 300
times ¹⁄₂ or 150 watt-hours, which is
equal to .15 kilowatt-hour.</p>

<p>To determine the output of the heater
is a little more difficult, but it may be
approximated as follows: Since the
object of the device is to convert electrical
energy into heat energy the output
must be measured in heat units.
The unit of heat most commonly employed
is the calorie, which is the heat
required to raise the temperature of
one gram of water one degree centigrade.
Hence, if a certain weight of
water has its temperature increased a
definite number of degrees centigrade
by the electric heater, then the total
heat imparted to the water in calories
will equal the weight of the water in
grams multiplied by the change in temperature
in degrees centigrade. Of
course, the heat generated by the heater
exceeds that obtained by the above
calculation, due to the fact that some
heat is imparted to the vessel containing
the water and to the supports for
the vessel, but it is only the heat imparted
to the water that must be considered,
as the other heat is not useful.</p>

<p>When the temperature of the water
is raised to the boiling point and a part
of the water is evaporated, the foregoing
method of calculating the heat
imparted to the water no longer holds
good, and the following method must
be used. Weigh the water before and<span class="pagenum" id="Page391">[391]</span>
immediately after the test to determine
the amount of evaporation. For each
gram of water evaporated there will be
required approximately 536 calories,
and the heat in calories imparted to
the water to raise its temperature to
the boiling point will be equal to the
difference between 100 and the initial
temperature of the water multiplied by
the weight of the water at the start.
To determine the efficiency, the input
to the heating element in electrical
units must be changed to heat units
which may be done by multiplying the
power in watts by the time in seconds
and this product in turn by .24, giving
the result in calories. The following
example may serve as a help in performing
such an experiment or test.</p>

<p>This value of efficiency may be increased
by insulating the vessel with a
nonconductor of heat and providing a
covering for it, thus decreasing the
losses to the air and surrounding
objects.</p>

<p>The efficiency of an electric stove or
electric iron, or, in fact, any electrically
heated device, may be determined in a
manner similar to the water heater.
In the case of a stove, place a vessel
filled with water on it and measure the
heat imparted to the water in a given
time, also the input to the heating element
in the same time, from which
data the efficiency may be calculated.
In the case of an electric iron, dampened
cloths may be ironed and the
actual water evaporated by the iron, determined
by weighing the cloths before
and after the ironing, together
with the increase in weight of the cloth
on the ironing board, the time the iron
is in use and the temperature of the
cloths. The actual water evaporated is
the difference in the weight of the
cloths before and after ironing, minus
the increase in weight of the cloth on
the ironing board, which takes up some
of the moisture from the cloths being
ironed.</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>It will almost appear impossible to
those unfamiliar with laboratory methods
that one may watch the vibrations—3,600

current in a little pocket mirror without
the use of any apparatus other
than a telephone receiver. The experiment
is very interesting and instructive,
one that may be performed at practically
no expense.</p>

<div class="container w35emmax">

</div><!--container-->

<p>Take an ordinary inexpensive watchcase

up the center opening with a cork, into

be closed with a plug having a central
opening about the size of a pin. Procure
a small rectangular pocket mirror
and remove the celluloid covering,
and then, across the back, solder a
piece of straight wire to form a vertical
spindle, about which the mirror
may be rotated. Connect any resistance,
such as a magnet coil of 10 or 20
ohms, in series with an incandescent
lamp, and then connect the receiver
terminals to the ends of this resistance.
In this manner an ideal alternating-current
supply of a few volts to operate
the receiver safely is secured. Turn on
the gas only sufficient to produce a
narrow pencil of flame, not over 1 in.
long. Mount the mirror as shown, or
hold the spindle between the thumb
and forefinger of the left hand while
rocking it back and forth with the
right. Ordinarily only a streak of
light will appear, but immediately
upon turning on the current this streak
will be broken up into a series of regular
waves, flatter or sharper according
to the speed with which the mirror is
rocked. After carefully noting the
wave form, connect the receiver with
the primary of an ordinary medical
coil, across the make-and-break, and
note the marked difference in the
waves.</p>

<p>By replacing the receiver with a
block of wood having a circular depression,
about 2 in. in diameter and ¹⁄₈ in
deep, over which is pasted a disk of
smooth paper, the waves set up by the
human voice may be observed if the
talking is done loudly and close to the
disk. The gas connection in this case
is made from the back of the block, as
shown. As the several vowels are
sounded, the characteristic wave from
each will be seen in the mirror. It is
also interesting to increase the pitch
of the voice and note how much finer
the waves become.</p>

for a Screen Door</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>An outside screen door causes considerable
annoyance by slamming when
exposed to the wind, even if it is
equipped with a bumper. Nothing
short of a door check will prevent this
slamming, so I made a very simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page393">[393]</span>
pneumatic check for our door, which
works entirely satisfactorily.</p>

<p>A discarded bicycle foot pump was
procured and hinged to the casing over
the door, as shown in the illustration.
The hinge was made as follows: Two
holes, A, were drilled through the
stirrup, as near the foot plate as possible;
two ordinary screw eyes were
turned into the door casing at B, and
two pins were passed through the holes
in the screw eyes and the holes in the
stirrup. This allows the pump to swing
when the door is opened. The end of
the plunger rod C is flattened and a
hole drilled through it to receive the
pin at the top of the bracket D, which
is screwed firmly to the door.</p>

<p>The action of the pump when the
door is opened can be readily understood.
The check is adjusted very
easily by the machine screw E, which
controls the exhaust of the air when
the door closes. The screw is turned
into the hole in the base of the pump
where the pipe was originally connected.
One side of the end of the
screw is slightly flattened to allow a
better adjustment. The pump can be
quickly removed by pulling out the
upper pin in the hinge part.—Contributed

<h2 class="lrgr nobreak">Common Mistakes in Model Making<br>
<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> H. J. GRAY</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">M</span><span class="afterlargecap">odels</span> made as a pastime or for
exhibition purposes should represent
correctly the full-sized machine,
not only as regards general design but
also in the proportioning of parts, the
finish, and the choice of materials. The
satisfaction derived from the possession
of a model is greater when it is
truly representative. Study and careful
measurement of the original are
necessary to attain this result, and provide
valuable experience in the application
of correct mechanical principles.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous, though perhaps
not the most frequent, errors
made by amateurs are in the proportioning
of the various parts. This
usually arises from insufficient study
of the original machine, and is often
sufficiently glaring to attract the attention
even of a casual observer. The
foundation or base of a model stationary
engine, for example, is often
painted to resemble brickwork. This
is correct, provided the spaces are proportioned
so as to represent bricks and
not three-ton slabs of granite.</p>

<p>Mistakes are made in the selection
of pulley wheels, both as regards the
character and the size of the pulley
that would be suitable for the particular
purpose.</p>

<p>The “cheese-head” or flat-head machine
screw appears to have a peculiar
fascination for the model maker, judging
from the frequency with which it
is misplaced. It is only necessary to
consider what would happen in a full-sized
machine if such screws were used
for making joints in valve rods, cylinder
covers, slide bars, for fixing bearing
caps, and the like, to realize how
completely such a defect mars the appearance
of a model to a discriminating
eye. Bolts, or, in some cases, studs
and nuts, should be used to give an
appearance of correct workmanship.</p>

<p>Many novices make a serious mistake
in the character of the finish given to
the various parts. This usually results
through devoting insufficient attention
to the method of manufacture
adopted in engineering practice. Under
the impression that a mottled appearance
gives an ornamental effect,
they will make a shaft end with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page395">[395]</span>
scraped finish. To the casual observer
there would be nothing amiss, but a
mistake of this kind would offend the
trained eye of an engineer, because it
is entirely unrepresentative. The object
of scraping sliding surfaces is to
obtain a greater degree of flatness by
removing small inequalities. As the
subsequent use of a file would only
undo the work of a scraper, the surface
is permitted to remain mottled, as left
by the scraping tool. But the end of
an engine shaft is not a sliding surface,
and in engineering practice would be
finished in a lathe.</p>

<p>Nickelplating is often resorted to in
order to produce a brilliant and supposedly
pleasing finish to the model of
a casting. This is obviously wrong, for
the actual casting—which might weigh
tons—would be painted, and not electroplated.</p>

<p>Locomotive wheels or stacks of polished
brass add to the appearance of a
model only in the eyes of the uninitiated.
Few persons would care to risk
a railroad journey if the engine had
brass wheels. Iron or steel is the correct
material to use. Brass is also often
used instead of iron for cylinders, connecting
rods, and starting levers on
models, or for steam pipes, which
should be made of steel or copper.</p>

<p>In certain cases there may be unusual
difficulties in using the correct
material for a machine part made to a
small scale. It is then permissible to
use other material, provided some attempt
is made to disguise the fact by
means of an appropriate finish. Copperplating,
for example, may be used
to disguise some other material, if the
parts should properly be made of copper.
It is often convenient to make a
model boiler of brass. It should not be
polished but bronzed, to represent the
iron or steel plates of a full-size boiler.</p>

wire is fixed near the middle of the
handles so that they pivot on its ends
when the lower ends of the handles
are pressed together, as shown in the

of wood, ¹⁄₄ in. thick, ¹⁄₂ in. wide, an
6¹⁄₂ in. long. Their ends are rounded
and slight notches are cut into the corners
near the ends, to provide for the
tying of the cords.</p>

<p>A wide rubber band, slipped over the
handles near their upper ends, causes
them to close at the top, and when the
fan is in use this will reverse the rotation
of the fan. It is necessary only to
squeeze the handles inward, and the
reverse action is repeated.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Photographing Electric Sparks</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Electric sparks may be photographed
with simple equipment, and the process
offers a diversion from the common
subjects for photography. The materials
necessary are a spark coil and current
source, a photographic plate, facilities
for developing it, and a sheet of
tin foil. The illustration shows a typical
photograph of an electric spark,
and the variety possible is unlimited.</p>

<div class="container w30emmax">

<img src="images/illo403a.jpg" alt="Photoraph of electric spark">

</div><!--container-->

<p>The process, which must be performed
in a dark room with a ruby
light, is as follows: Over the mouth
of a small glass bottle, partly filled
with talcum powder, tie a piece of
cheesecloth, to act as a sieve. Arrange
the material on a table, the sheet of tin
foil lying flat, and a photographic plate
on top of it, coated side upward.</p>

<p>Spread a thin layer of the powder on
the plate, through the sieve. Attach
a needle to an electric wire and fix the
other end of the
wire to one of
the secondary
posts of the
spark coil. Attach
a second
wire to the other
post of the spark
coil and to the
sheet of tin foil.
Care must be
taken in handling
the needle that only the insulated portion,
where it is joined to the wire,
comes in contact with the fingers, or a
shock may result. Place the point of
the needle near the middle of the plate
and turn on the current, permitting it
to produce a spark of not more than
one second’s duration. If the exposure
is longer than that the result will not
be satisfactory. Wipe off the powder
and develop the plate. If care has
been taken in the process, a photograph
similar to the one shown in the
illustration will result.</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>To test a file hold it so that the light
will be reflected sharply from the teeth
and observe whether their edges are
flattened and appear as white lines.
If so, the file is dull and should be
recut if of considerable size and value.</p>

<p>Files should not be thrown into
drawers and mixed with other tools,
but should be carefully set in racks or<span class="pagenum" id="Page401">[401]</span>
drawers for the purpose. A mechanic
would not throw a straightedge into
a drawer containing other tools, and a
file should be given similar consideration,
as every nick in the teeth impairs
the efficiency of the file.</p>

<p>Files may be sharpened by dipping
them into sulphuric acid, but care
must be taken not to permit the acid
to come into contact with one’s clothes
or person. Water is used to wash off
the acid.</p>

<p>Files should be provided with individual
handles. This prevents injury
to the hand of the worker and aids in
the proper use of the file. Handles
should be carefully fitted and be made
of a size proportionate to the file. In
removing a handle from a file, strike
the handle at the end nearest the file,
by sliding a piece of hard wood along
the surface of the file, as the blow is
struck with it. Do not use another
file or metal object in thus removing
a handle, as it will injure the latter.</p>

By Robert Baker</p>

</div><!--illotext-->

</div><!--container-->

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">P</span><span class="afterlargecap">igeon</span> houses need not be eyesores,
as is often the case, but
may be made to harmonize with the
surroundings, adding beauty to a dull
spot, and even making the grounds of
a home more attractive. The house
described will accommodate 20 pigeons,
and additional stories of the same type
may be added to provide for more.
Nearly all of the wood necessary may
be obtained from boxes, and the other
materials are also readily available at
small cost. The construction is such
that a boy handy with ordinary carpentry
tools may undertake it successfully.</p>

<p>The house is constructed in general
on principles used in buildings, having
a framed gable roof, rough-boarded
and shingled. The interior arrangement
is original, being based on the
Indian swastika or good-luck sign.
While the construction is simple, it
must be carried out systematically.
The process outlined also follows in
general the typical methods in building
construction.</p>

<p>The foundation need not be considered,
since the house rests upon a
post, and the construction thus begins
with the lower story. The floor and the
ceiling are similar in construction, as
shown in <a href="#Fig405a">Fig. 1</a>. In framing them
into the lower story, as may be observed
in <a href="#Fig405b">Fig. 8</a>, the cleats are placed
below on the floor and above in the
ceiling. The construction is identical,
however. The cleats are fastened to
the boards with screws, although nails,
clinched carefully, may be used. The
4-in. hole at the center should be made
accurately, so as to fit the shoulder
portion at the top of the post, shown
in <a href="#Fig405a">Fig. 2</a>. The latter may be cut of
a length to suit; about 9 ft. will be
found convenient. The notches in the
top of the post are to fit the ridge pole
and center rafters of the roof frame,
as shown in <a href="#Fig405b">Fig. 10</a>. They should not
be made until the house is ready for
the roof boards.</p>

<p>The pieces for the compartments, as
arranged on the floor in <a href="#Fig405a">Fig. 3</a>, are
made next. <a href="#Fig405a">Figs. 4 and 5</a> show the
detailed sizes of these pieces, of which
four each must be made. The sizes
shown must be followed exactly, as
they are designed to give the proper
space for entrances and to fit around
the 4-in. square hole, through which
the post is to fit. The pieces marked
A, B, and C, in Figs. 4 and 5, correspond
to those similarly marked in
Fig. 3.</p>

<p>The pieces are nailed together to
form the swastika in the following
manner:</p>

<p>Mark the pieces A, B, and C, as
shown. Measure 4 in. from one end of
each piece marked A, and square a
pencil line across, 4 in. from the end.
Arrange the pieces in pairs. Place one
end of one piece against the side of
the other piece in the pair, so that the
pencil line is even with the end, permitting
the 4-in. portion to project.
Nail both pairs in this position. Then
fit the two parts together to form a
4-in. square in the center, as shown in
<a href="#Fig405a">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

<p>Fit the pieces C to the pieces B at
an angle, as shown in <a href="#Fig405a">Fig. 3</a>, trimming
off the projecting corners where the
pieces are joined. Nail them together,
and they are ready to be fixed to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page404">[404]</span>
end of the pieces A, already nailed. By
nailing the joined pieces B and C to
the end of the pieces A, as shown in
Fig. 3, the swastika is completed. Fix
it into place, with the center hole
exactly over the square hole in the
floor, by means of nails or screws
driven through the floor.</p>

<p>Two small strips must now be nailed
to the floor at each side of the swastika.
They should be exactly 4¹⁄₂ in.
long, and are to hold the slides, <a href="#Fig405b">Fig. 9</a>,
which shut off the various compartments.
The slides are shown hanging
by chains in the headpiece of this
article, and are shown in place in
<a href="#Fig405b">Fig. 8</a>.</p>

<p>Fix the ceiling into place in the
same manner, being careful that the
square holes fit together, and that the
cleats are on the upper side. Turn the
construction over and fix into place
the small strips for the slides, as was
done on the floor.</p>

<p>The fixed screens, <a href="#Fig405b">Fig. 6</a>, and the
doors, Fig. 7, are constructed similarly.
They are built up of ¹⁄₂-in. wood, and
vary in size to fit their respective places
in the framework. Observe that the
fixed screens are ¹⁄₄ in. higher than the
doors, and that they are fastened between
the ceiling and floor, bracing
them. The wire grating is ¹⁄₂-in.
square mesh, and is fixed between the
pieces of the doors and the screens
when they are built up.</p>

<p>The doors are shown secured by
combination strap hinges, bent over
the baseboard. Plain butts may be
used and the lower portion of the
hinge covered by the baseboard, a
recess being cut to receive the part
covered. In the latter instance the
doors should be fixed into place immediately
after the screens are set.
Catches and chains may then be
placed on the doors. Next nail the
baseboards into place. They are 2¹⁄₂
in. wide and may be mitered at the corners,
or fitted together in a square, or
butt, joint. The latter joint may be
nailed more readily.</p>

<p>The slides, shown in <a href="#Fig405b">Fig. 9</a>, may
now be made and fitted into their
grooves. The handles are made of
strips of band iron, drilled for screws
and bent into the proper shape. It is
important that the slides be constructed
of three pieces, as shown, so
that they will not warp or curve from
exposure. The main piece is cut 7³⁄₄ in.
long, and the strips, ¹⁄₂ in. square, are
nailed on the ends.</p>

<p>The construction of the framing for
the roof should next be taken up. This
probably requires more careful work
than any other part of the pigeon
house, yet it is simple, as shown in
Fig. 10. Note that the rafters are set
upon a frame, or plate as it is called,
built up of pieces 3 in. wide. It should
be made ¹⁄₄ in. wider and longer on the
inside than the ceiling board, so as to
fit snugly over it. The joints at the
corners are “halved” and nailed both
ways. This gives a stronger structure
than butting them squarely and nailing
them. The end rafters should be
fitted in before fixing the others. It is
best to make a diagram of the end of
the roof framing on a sheet of paper,
or a board, and to fit the rafter joints
in this way before cutting them. The
rafters are then nailed into place.</p>

<p>The “rough boards” to cover the
rafters may now be nailed down. They
are spaced ¹⁄₂ in. apart so as to permit
thorough drying, as is done in larger
buildings. They project 2 in. beyond
the ends of the plate frame, supporting
the rafters. A ¹⁄₂-in. strip is nailed
over the ends to give a neat finish. The
roof may be shingled, or covered with
tar paper, or any roofing material.</p>

<p>Nail a 1-in. strip under each end of
the roof and nail the gable ends into
place. One gable end is provided with
a door, as shown, and the other has
an opening fitted with a wire screen
of the same size as the door.</p>

<p>The gable story rests on the lower
story, and the notches in the top of the
post should fit snugly to the ridge and
center rafters, as shown in <a href="#Fig405b">Fig. 10</a>.
This will aid in supporting the house
firmly. If additional stories are added
it would be well to place a post at each
corner of the house. The upper story
may be removed for cleaning, or for
transporting the house.</p>

<p>The post should be sunk into the
ground about 2¹⁄₂ ft. and set into a
concrete foundation, if convenient.
This will insure a more nearly permanent
as well as a more rigid support.
Care should be taken that the post is
set plumb and this can be accomplished
if a plumb bob is used. The post
should be braced to keep it vertical,

<h2 class="nobreak">Using Plate Holder
as Printing Frame</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>A cumbersome part of a commercial
photographer’s equipment when “on
the road” is his set of printing frames.
Amateur photographers who have cameras
using plates of more than one
size find these frames an expensive
part of their outfits. A method that is
practical and inexpensive for these requirements
in many cases, is as follows:
Place the sensitized paper in the
plate holder with the emulsion side up.
Then put the plate in the holder in the
same way as if about to expose it in a
camera, but with the emulsion side
down, so that the sensitized side of the
paper and the emulsion side of the plate
are in contact. The paper and plate
are thus held in close contact without
the use of springs, as in the regular
printing frames. The plate and paper
can be removed by pressing the spring
catch at the bottom of the holder, and
the plate is not easily moved while in
place.—Francis W. Clinton, Brooklyn,
New York.</p>

Enlargements</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>To avoid expensive waste of paper
in making large bromide enlargements
the following device is useful: Cut an
oblong sheet of stiff cardboard, 5¹⁄₄
by 4 in., with a central opening, measuring
3³⁄₄ by 1¹⁄₂ in. Along the lower
edge of the central opening mark off
five spaces of ³⁄₄ in. each, and number
them from 1 to 5. Glue a strip of cardboard,
1 in. wide, at the top and the
bottom of the oblong, on the back.
Now glue a second strip of cardboard
over each of those just attached, making
the second strips slightly wider to
form grooves similar to those in a sliding-top
box.</p>

<p>Cut a piece of cardboard, wide
enough to slide easily in these grooves,
and about 7 in. long. In the center of
it, cut an opening, 1¹⁄₂ in. long and ³⁄₄
in. wide, with the longer dimension
extending across the strip. By inserting
this slide into the grooves, the
opening in it may be shifted to correspond
to any of the five ³⁄₄-in. indications
at the lower edge of the opening
in the oblong frame.</p>

<p>Focus the enlargement on the easel
and put the cap on the lens. Then pin
a 1¹⁄₂-in. strip of bromide paper where
a good range of detail will fall upon it.
Pin the oblong card over the bromide
strip and make five successive exposures,
of increasing duration, by sliding
the strip so that its opening is
opposite the number indications on the
oblong. Note the particulars of exposure
at the time and later develop the
strip of bromide paper. Suppose the
exposures were of 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40
seconds’ duration, and upon development
it was found that the first and
second exposures were much underexposed
and that the fifth was overexposed;
the third and fourth being
only slightly under and overexposed,
respectively. Then the mean of these
two, that is 24 plus 32 divided by 2,
or 28 seconds, will be approximately
the correct exposure. The use of this
device will effect a considerable saving.—H.

<h2 class="nobreak">A Gas-Stove Lighter</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>For lighting the gas stove, matches
are not only untidy but inconvenient.
In lieu thereof I use a simple affair
consisting of a wood handle with a
large nail set in the end, with which it
is only necessary to touch the burner
in order to start a flame. There is
nothing to wear out and no parts to
renew. Furthermore this gas lighter
uses only one wire—a fact that is apt
to strike a person as being rather unusual
on first thought. However, if
the reader will connect one terminal of
a 60-watt lamp with the gas main or to
the gas stove and then touch the other
terminal successively with each of the
two ends of the live wires it will be
found that the lamp will light up with
one terminal but not with the other,
for the reason that one side of the circuit
is usually grounded at most electric-light
plants as a precaution against
lightning.</p>

<p>All that is necessary to get a spark
is to provide a suitable resistance coil
with an iron core, so that the fuse will
not be blown and to secure sufficient
inductance to get a hot spark. The
writer uses an ordinary 50-ohm telephone
induction coil, in which the primary
and secondary are placed in series
by the diagonal connection indicated in
the sketch. Almost any coil or electromagnet
of 25-ohm resistance, or more,
connected in a circuit will prove safe
and give a hot spark. Place the coil
in some out-of-the-way corner, and run
one strand of the usual flexible cord
to the handle, which should be hung at
some convenient point at the right-hand
side of the stove. Let the handle
itself be long enough so that there will
be no tendency to catch hold of the
metal point. Run the flexible cord
through the center and out at the lower
end, into which a wire nail with the
head removed is driven. Solder the
wire to the nail, and the lighter is ready.</p>

<p>An excellent pair of leggings for use
in brush and forest land can be made
in a few minutes
from birch bark
cut in the woods.
Select a suitable
tree, about 6 or
8 in. in diameter,
and cut into the
heavy bark to
obtain two
rolls around the
circumference of
the tree, taking
care not to cut
deep enough to
injure it. Fit
these sections
around the legs
leaving 6-in. portions
overlapping. Trim the bark to
the proper shape and soak it in water
to soften the grain. Place the bark
close to the fire until it curls. The leggings
are then ready for use.</p>

<p>Many gardeners derive as much
pleasure from the orderly arrangement
of the plants in their “farms” as from
any other feature of this home diversion,
and I am one of them. In order
to facilitate the planting I made a reel
like that shown in the sketch. The

of a piece of broomstick to which two
small tins, or box covers, are nailed.
A wire handle made of a long nail is
fitted to one end, and a shoulder hook
is used as a stop for the handle when
it is desired to check the line. A screw
eye driven into the back of the frame
holds it at various heights on the stake.
This device is far superior to the common
use of two stakes for the planting
cord.—James M. Kane, Doylestown,

<h2 class="nobreak">Kinks on the Care of Umbrellas</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Deriving long use from an umbrella
depends in part on proper selection,
care of the cloth and frame, and precautions
against loss or theft. A silk
cover is desirable to shed rain, and a
cotton one for a sunshade. The hot
sun dries out the silk and heats the
metal ribs under it, quickly destroying
it. If silk is used for sun protection,
wet the cover occasionally. Always
set an umbrella to dry, handle down
if there is not space to dry it open.</p>

<p>A broad ribbon loop on the handle
of a woman’s umbrella permits carrying
it on the wrist and prevents forgetting
it. An umbrella with a removable
handle can be folded into a suitcase,
and putting the handle in the
pocket when leaving the umbrella in
any public place makes it less liable to
theft. An umbrella should bear the
name and address of the owner.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A Simple Polarity Indicator</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>An ordinary compass, fitted flush in
a wooden frame as shown in the sketch
forms the basis for the polarity indicator
described. The N, or north, and
S, or south, points of the compass
should run lengthwise with the frame
with the former on the end farthest
from the binding posts, C and D. Five
turns of No. 18 gauge, or any similar
wire are wound lengthwise around the
frame and over the compass. The ends
of the wires terminate at the two binding<span class="pagenum" id="Page423">[423]</span>
posts. Begin at C and wind toward
the compass, binding the wire at D.</p>

<div class="container w30emmax">

<img src="images/illo427a.jpg" alt="Compass as polarity indicator">

</div><!--container-->

<p>If the two ends of a wire are free,
and it is desired to know whether there
is any current present, and if so, its
polarity, fasten one wire to the post C
and the other to D. Before connecting
the wires, hold the compass and
frame in such a way that the needle is
over the N point on the compass dial.
If, after the wires are connected, the
needle moves, there is a current flowing.
If the needle is deflected toward
the east, the negative wire is on
C; if it is deflected toward the
west, the positive
wire is on C.</p>

<p>When it is desired to ascertain
the polarity
of a wire, which is covered by a
floor, ceiling, or molding, hold the
compass as explained, and either directly
above or below the wire. Then
turn on the current. If the instrument
is above the wire, the wire extending
parallel with it north and south, and
the needle is deflected toward the west,
the current is flowing from the north
to the south end of the wire. If the
wire runs east and west and the needle
is deflected to the west, the current is
running from west to east.</p>

<p>If the wire runs on a diagonal between
the directions mentioned, and
the needle is deflected toward the west,
he current is flowing from the quadrant
between N and W on the compass
dial toward the quadrant between S
and E. If the instrument is held over
the wire and the needle is deflected toward
E, the polarity is the opposite
to that last indicated. Should the instrument
be held below the wire, if
the needle goes toward W, it is equivalent
to going toward E when above the
wire.—H. Sterling Parker, Brooklyn,
New York.</p>

<p>Those who wish a small desk light
that may be pushed back out of the
way in the daytime, will find the accompanying
sketch of interest. When in
use on a roll-top desk, the lamp is
placed on top near the edge, so that the
bulb overhangs. A 25-watt lamp will
light the bed of the desk, and the small
metal shade is so placed that no part of
the bulb is visible to the eye of the
worker. By providing a suitable base,
the lamp may be adapted to other uses.
A stock paper
weight, about 2
in. in diameter
and covered with
green felt, was
used as a base.
An ordinary
drop-cord socket
is provided, and
to one side of
the top cap a strip of brass, ¹⁄₁₆ by ¹⁄₂
in., is soldered. A hole is drilled near
the end of this strip so that the screw
which holds the knob will also hold the
socket. Connect the flexible cord in
the usual manner.</p>

<div class="container w25emmax">

<p>The shade is made of sheet metal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page425">[425]</span>

front shorter than the opposite edge.
Make a sketch of the bulb, and determine
the lengths of the two sides A
and B, and then draw two concentric
circles of corresponding radii on paper,
as indicated in the small diagram. The
proper curve for the shade will then lie
between these two circles. Cut a paper
pattern, and form it into a cone. After
the proper shape is determined, mark
it on the metal, cut it to shape, and
solder it. A small spring clip, C, engages
the tip of the bulb; the back of
the shade is held by a piece of spring
wire, D. It is easy to spring the shade
off in replacing the bulb. The outside
of the shade should be enameled an

<p>A device used in an amateur vaudeville
sketch with good effect, and
which is interesting for play purposes,
was made of a ¹⁄₃₂ by 9 by 14-in. piece
of sheet spring brass, rigged as shown.
In the center, near the upper edge, a
small pulley was soldered, and at the
center of the bottom edge a small hole
was drilled. In it was fastened one
end of a 4-ft. string which ran up
through the pulley. The other end
was fastened to a strap to fit around
the leg just above the knee. At the
two upper corners of the brass sheet
two slots were cut to accommodate
similar straps, as fastenings. When the
wearer stands in a normal position the
chest is as usual, but by straightening
the body and slightly moving the
strapped leg back, the brass sheet is
bowed outward, giving the appearance
indicated.—Arthur L. Kaser, South

three disks, A, Fig. 1, from 1 to 4 in. in
diameter, according to the size of lock
desired. For one with 2-in. disks, as

<p class="caption allclear">This Wooden Combination Lock Gives Good Service
and is Easily Made</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The case of the lock is shown in Fig.
1. It is made large enough to mount
the disks, as shown. Around the edges
of the inside surface of the lid fasten
strips a trifle thicker than the disks.
Place the disks in the positions shown,
drilling small holes in the baseboard
for the nail axles. The bolts, D, and
the piece, E, are made of hard wood,
fastened with a lap joint. On each
side of the bar, D, fasten cleats, F, to
hold it in position. The handle, H,
moves in a slot in the lid, and is fixed
to the bar, E.</p>

<p>The door, or lid, on which the lock
is to be used, is provided with openings,
J, as shown in Fig. 3. The axles
C, project through openings, as bearings.
When the windows J, through
which the combinations are read, are
made, place the ends of the bolts in
the slots of the disks and screw the
lock in position. Mark on each disk
the point exactly in the center of the
window, enabling one to work the
combination temporarily. To lock the
device, push the handle to the left and
turn the axles. To unlock it, turn the
axles until the pencil marks appear in
the middle of the windows, and throw
the bolts.</p>

<p>Next make paper dials, K, of a diameter
as shown in Fig. 2. Divide the
circumference into from 50 to 100
equal parts, according to the size of
the dial, and draw radii, as shown.
Number at least every fifth point. To
the face of each disk, A, with small
thumb tacks, fasten one of the dials,
placing the combination numbers
selected exactly over the pencil marks
made in setting the temporary combination.
Verify the combination before
locking it. Unless the slots in the
disks are a little wider than the ends
of the bolts, the combination must be
very closely adjusted. An aid in setting
the combination is a line on the
glass or a point of black paper, as
shown in Fig. 2. The combination
may be changed by setting the dials in
new positions. The large number of
combinations possible makes it very
difficult to obtain the combination. For
most purposes, two disks are sufficient
in a lock of this kind.</p>

<p>To make a sundial accurately it is
necessary to lay out the lines for the
particular locality where it is to be

</div><!--container-->

<p>The illustrations show how the dial
is made. The lines, as indicated in
<a href="#Fig436a">Fig. 1</a>, should be laid out very carefully,
first on a pattern. Draw a horizontal
line near the top which represents the
six-o’clock line, A-VI, in <a href="#Fig436c">Fig. 2</a>. Then
lay out another line AH, at right angles
to A-VI. Take a point C at any
convenient place and construct the
right-angled triangle ABD. The angle
CAB should be equal to the degree of
latitude of the place. The angle CBD
equals CAB. Take a compass and set
it to a radius equal to the side BD, and
draw the quadrant DF from E. From
D draw the line DG out for same distance
and parallel with A-VI. Now
divide the quadrant DF into six equal
parts. Draw the lines E1, E2, E3, etc.,
and where they intersect the line DG,
draw the lines from A, as A-I, A-II,
A-III, etc. These are the hour lines.
Divide each of the six divisions of the
quadrant into four parts, and draw the
lines, as shown between the 3 and 4
divisions. These are the 15-minute
parts. Each of these parts may be divided
in turn, and this is best done by
eye, unless the dial is quite large.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The power used is an 8-ft. windmill
that I constructed, using a buggy
wheel as the frame. The cylinder must
be run at a fairly high speed, the fan
nearly as fast, and the beaters may be
run much slower; this is taken care of
by the relative size of the pulleys. The
screen between the fan and beaters
must be of small mesh so that grain
will not fall through into the fan chamber.
The sieve through which the
grain drops must be the proper size for
grain, and can be varied for the different
kinds of grain or seed threshed.
It is better to put only the heads of
grain into the thresher, as long straws
twist about the rollers. The material
to be threshed is fed into the cylinder
in the usual manner, and takes its
course as indicated by the arrows, the
grain falling to the spout at the bottom,
and the straw and chaff being
blown out at the exhaust for it. Soft
wood was used in the construction,
⁷⁄₈-in. stock for the heavier pieces, and
³⁄₈ or ¹⁄₄-in. stock for the other parts.
The curved housing for the fan was
made of tin. Leather or rope belts,
fitted tightly, may be used. The power
is applied on the cylinder pulley, hand
or other power being suitable.—F. E.

Novelty</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>A druggist recently puzzled thousands
with a novel window display. A
small white ball in a 1-in. glass tube,
about 10 in. long, displayed in a show
window, would sink to the bottom, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page445">[445]</span>
slowly ascend, only to sink as before. A
sign reading “What Makes It Move?”
kept the crowd guessing. The tube
was apparently filled with water. The
construction is simple. The tube is
about three-quarters full of carbonated
soda water. The white ball is an ordinary
moth ball. The ball sinks, and
when it becomes soaked gradually as it
lowers, bubbles of gas cling to it, carrying
it to the top of the solution. There
the gas escapes, destroying the ball’s
buoyancy, and causing it to sink again,
This process is repeated over and over.—David

within the range of an amateur in
leather work, who will observe the instructions
carefully. Seal, morocco,
pigskin, and ooze sheep are satisfactory.
Skiver, or thin leather, and silk
moiré make suitable linings. When
the processes involved in the making
of the billfold are mastered, numerous
other small articles in leather will suggest
themselves, and can be made similarly.</p>

<div class="container w35emmax" id="Fig446b">

</div><!--container-->

<p>The finished billfold is shown with
the cardcase side up; folded, and with
the bill compartment open, in <a href="#Fig447a">Fig. 2</a>.
Begin the making of it by cutting a
pattern of stiff cardboard for the main
portion, or body part No. 1, as shown
in <a href="#Fig446b">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p>Make a second pattern for body part
No. 2, as shown in <a href="#Fig446b">Fig. 1</a>. Trim the
leather to fit the patterns, a straight
edge of metal being placed over the
pattern as a guide for the knife. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page447">[447]</span>
close-grained hardwood board, or a
piece of sheet zinc, is suitable as a base
for cutting the leather.</p>

<p>Cut pieces of lining slightly larger
than the patterns. If skiver is used, it
must be glued to the leather with a
good quality of leather
glue, which should be
pliable so as not to
crack the leather. Do
not stretch the lining,
but merely smooth it
gently, as otherwise it
may cause the leather
to buckle. Place the
glued parts under a
light weight to dry.
In fitting the silk lining
into place, apply a
thin stripe of glue
around the edges only,
and permit them to extend
beyond the leather.
Then trim them
off neatly.</p>

<p>Part No. 1 is to be
folded to form the back
of the billfold and also
the two pockets for
cards. The parts are
glued as shown in <a href="#Fig447b">Fig.
3</a>. Weight the billfold
and permit the glue to
dry. The sewing may then be undertaken.</p>

<p>The neatness of the billfold will depend
largely on the care with which
the sewing is done, and the finish on the
edges. Draw a straight line with a
blunt-point tool along the edges to be
sewed, ³⁄₁₆ in. from them. Mark the
spacing for an inch of the stitches on a
strip of paper and transfer them to the
stitching line. Punch the holes, making
certain that each is made with the
awl held vertical, as shown at D. Back
the open ends
with strips of
cardboard when
punching holes
in them. Heavy,
waxed silk of a color to match the
leather is used for the sewing. The
work may be done by hand without a
holder, clamped between two boards.
Thread the two needles and start them
from the right side, as at E. Pass the
needle from the first hole through the
second as at F. With the needles then
in position, as at G, continue this stitch.
Tie the ends of the thread neatly at the
end of the stitching. Trim the edges
and tool them to a smooth finish with
a suitable metal tool, or rod, heated
moderately, applying water with the
finger tip.</p>

Sharpened Quickly by
the Use of This Rigging</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>With this device, one can quickly
sharpen the lawn mower, or perhaps
earn money sharpening the neighbors’
machines. Because
several
knives in a lawn
mower work
against the cutting blade, it is difficult
to sharpen a mower satisfactorily with
a file or stone. A usual method is to
reverse the cutting-wheel cogs, turn the
mower upside down, and run it backward
over the ground. By the use of
grinding paste on the cutting blade the
cutting wheel tends to sharpen itself.
This process can be improved by supporting
the mower, as shown at A, the
blocks permitting the mower’s driving
wheels to rest outside them. A block,
B, supports the wooden roller. Remove
the driving wheels, and the gears which
turn the cutting wheel. Take the gear
from one end and put it in the other
end, replacing the driving wheel. By
revolving the latter backward, the cutting
wheel will also turn backward.
Apply a paste of emery powder and
lubricating oil to the cutting blade, and
adjust the blade so that it comes fairly
into contact with the cutting wheel.
Turn the driving wheel backward, and
gradually tighten the adjustment until
a good edge on the cutting blade and
the knives is produced.</p>

<p>A handle fixed on the driving wheel,
as shown at C, makes turning it easier.
After sharpening, replace the gears,
clean the bearings thoroughly, and replace
the driving wheels.—Ed. M.

Leave Their Roost</p>

<p>Those in the habit of shutting their
poultry houses at night to prevent disturbance
or loss by night-prowling animals,
will be interested in a contrivance
that makes this unnecessary. The principle
of the mechanism, as illustrated
is that the opening to the poultry house
is closed after the fowls have gone to
roost, and in the morning when they
descend from the roost, the door automatically
opens, and they are free to
go out. The spring door opens inside
with hinges at the side, and a suitable
bumper. The spring has just sufficient
tension to cause the door to open when
the catch is released.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page449">[449]</span></p>

<p>The roost is fitted up as shown in
the detail. One end is held by a bolt,
while the other rests on a coil spring
compressed by the weight of the fowls
on the roost. A cord is attached at
the spring end, passing through pulleys
to the door, where it is fastened to the
end of the bolt catch. The door is
closed after the fowls are on the roost.
The spring end is compressed to a level
position, by their weight. The instant
the birds leave the roost, it rises and
pulls the cord, releasing the catch, and
permitting the door to open.—George

<span class="author"><span class="smcap">By</span> E. R. GARFIELD</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p class="chapstart"><span class="largecap">T</span><span class="afterlargecap">he</span> boy who likes to play games in
which the lead soldier and other
features of imitation warfare have a
part, can make his own lead soldiers,
and other castings, by the use of a
plaster-of-Paris mold. If he cannot
undertake this work alone, the process
is interesting for his older brother, or
even for “daddy.” A mold of plaster
of Paris, as shown in the illustration,
is used for the casting box. The hollow
impression of the soldier is filled with
the molten lead, which is poured in
through the sprue hole at the top.
When the lead
cools, the mold is
opened, the casting
removed, and
the process repeated.
An entire
army can thus be
made with a single
mold.</p>

<p>First obtain a
small lead soldier,
and coat it with
shellac. Make a
box somewhat
larger than the
pattern for the
soldier, as shown
in the sketch.
Make it about 1¹⁄₂
in. deep, and set
bolts near the corners,
as shown,
pouring the
plaster around them. Fill the box half
full of plaster of Paris. While still soft,
press the pattern into the center of the
plaster so that half its thickness is imbedded.
Permit the under mold to dry,
and remove the pattern. Shellac the
surface of the plaster and the impression.
Wrap a layer of oiled paper
around the bolts. Replace the pattern
in the impression and fill the remaining
half of the box with plaster, and
permit it to dry.</p>

<p>Also make a small wooden plug, and
set it in the center, its point touching
the pattern, and pour the plaster around
it. When the mold is dry remove this
plug, thus forming the sprue hole,
through which the molten lead is
poured into the mold.</p>

<p class="caption">Lead Soldiers, and Many Other Small Castings, can
be Made by the Use of This Plaster-of-Paris Mold</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>When the second part of the mold is
dry, lift it carefully from the under
mold, and remove the pattern. Shellac
the surface of the top mold, cleaning
away any small bits of plaster around
the edges. Trim down the box so that
the top mold projects over it about ³⁄₈
in., making it easy to drop the top mold
into place over the bolts. To use the
mold, make certain
that it is clean
inside and set the
top into place.
Fasten down the
wing nuts at the
washers. Be very
careful that the
mold is dry, as hot
metal poured on a
wet surface may
cause a dangerous
splash. Repeat
this process, and
if care is taken
about 300 castings
can be made with
one mold. The
soldiers can be
painted suitably
and even sold in
sets. The process
can be adapted to
many forms of other small castings,
using other suitable metals, or wax,
where the casting is to be molded into
shape further.</p>

<p>A new type of bow gun that a boy

the gun, cut a soft pine board, 40 in.<span class="pagenum" id="Page459">[459]</span>
long and 5 in. wide. With a saw and
knife, cut the gun form as shown. Cut
a groove along the top of the barrel,
where the arrow will lie ready to be
shot out when the hickory bow is released.
The magazine holding the five
arrows is made of thin boards, 24 in.
long, and is held in place by four small
strips. The magazine is 3 in. deep,
thus permitting the five arrows to lie
evenly in it without crowding. The
bow is of seasoned hickory and is set
into the end of the barrel. The notch
in which the bowstring catches, should
be cut just under the rear end of the
magazine. The trigger is an L-shaped,
pivoted piece, and pushes the cord off
the notch when ready to fire. As soon
as the first arrow leaves the gun the
one just above it drops down into the
groove when the bowstring is again
pulled back into place behind the notch.
Pressure on the trigger shoots this arrow,
another takes its place, and the
cord is pulled back once more. The
arrows should be of light pine, 22 in.
long and ¹⁄₂ in. square, the rear end
notched and the front pointed. To
make the arrow shoot in a straight
course, and to give it proper weight, the
head end should be bored with a ³⁄₁₆ in.
bit, 3 in. deep, and melted lead run into
the hole.—E. F. Dalton, Cincinnati,

<h2 class="nobreak">Egg Beater Made into Winder for
Model Aeroplanes</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<div class="container w20emmax">

<img src="images/illo463b.jpg" alt="Egg beater to wind up model aeroplane motor">

</div><!--container-->

<p>One of the features which take the
joy out of flying elastic-driven model
aeroplanes is the
time taken to wind
them up. For 10
cents and very little
work a fast winder
can be made out of
an ordinary geared
egg beater. Remove
the outer small
pinion and the
revolving beater
attached to it. Then
cut the other beater
off at A, as shown
in the sketch, and
the spindle at B. A
few turns of tinned wire soldered to the
spindle will keep the pinion from sliding
off. Another piece of the same
wire may be soldered to the two arms,
at C, to strengthen them. In use, the
hub of the propeller is inserted between
the two arms, as indicated and the rubber
wound.—Morris G. Miller, New
Rochelle, N. Y.</p>

Guards against Burns</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<div class="container w25emmax">

<img src="images/illo463c.jpg" alt="Stove lighter">

</div><!--container-->

<p>A stove lighter for gasoline or similar
stoves can be made quickly. Cut
a piece of tin, 7 in. long and 1 in. wide.
Place a lamp,
wick on the tin
so that a part of
it projects from
the end of the
tin. Fold the tin
so that the wick
is held, but so
that it can be
drawn out when
needed. Saturate
the wick in kerosene, or other thicker
oil. When wishing to light one or more
burners of the stove, light the wick and
apply it to the burners. The stove can
be lighted with less danger of burning
the hands than when a match is used
directly.—Lee M. Delzell, Maroa, Ill.</p>

<img src="images/illo464a.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">The Alligator is Drawn Along with a String, and the
Jaws and Tail Flip Up and Down</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>A toy alligator that opens its mouth
and wags its tail as it is pulled along
can be made of wood by a boy, with
a jackknife. The various parts, as
shown, are cut from soft wood, ¹⁄₂ in.
thick. The method of fastening the
parts is shown in the side sectional
view. When the wheels turn, the cams
A, set on the crank portions of the
wheel axles, raise and lower the jaw
and tail. The upper jaw is 1 in. wide
at the widest part, and 3 in. long. The
lower jaw is smaller, and the same
length. The body is 6 in. long, and
tapering in width from 1¹⁄₂ to ³⁄₄ in.
The tail is 4³⁄₄ in. long, and ³⁄₄ in. wide.
Holes are drilled in each piece near
the edge, at joining points, through
which wires are drawn, and clamped,
as at B. The legs are shown in detail.
They are attached to the body by
drilling a ¹⁄₁₆-in. hole in each, and a
hole through the body, through which
the fastenings are passed. The lower
end of the legs are fastened to the base,
which is 3 by 9 in. long. Square holes,
1 in. wide, near each end, are provided
for the cams A. The axles and wheels
are made as shown. The axles fit
tightly in the wheels, so that the latter
can move the axles around with
each turn. The axles are made from
¹⁄₈-in. wire, bent as shown, and should
be long enough, after passing through
the bottom, to extend through the
wheels on each side.—Charles C. Wagner,
Los Angeles, Calif.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Angle Bracket Gives Leverage
on Door Spring</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Frequently, in placing a coil spring
on a screen or other door, the casing
is flush with the door, and it is
difficult to give the spring the desired
leverage. If it is attached to
the casing directly, the surface is
marred by the rubbing of the spring.
A good method is to set a small iron
bracket, either homemade of strap iron
or one of the commercial type, on the
casing and attach the end of the spring
to the bracket. This prevents the
spring from rubbing on the door and
casing, and gives it freedom of action.—Harry
L. Dixon, Chicago, Ill.</p>

and Mirror</h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<div class="container w15emmax">

<img src="images/illo464b.jpg" alt="Light bulb behind mirror">

</div><!--container-->

<p>A small mirror combined with a
shaded electric lamp affords a nearly
perfect shaving
lamp, and facial
toilet mirror.
The mirror
should be 1 in.
smaller all
around than the
reflector. By soldering
two
lengths of stiff
wire to the back
of the mirror
frame, it can be clamped to the reflector,
as shown. The indirect light
from the reflector illuminates the face
without shadows or glare, adding to
the comfort of shaving. The mirror
can be removed, and the lamp used for
other purposes.—Thomas W. Benson,
